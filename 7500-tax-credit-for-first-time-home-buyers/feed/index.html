					<description><![CDATA[Hi Brett, I don&#039;t believe you will be able to claim both.  
However, the 15000 tax credit is quite a bit different than the 7500 tax credit.   According to the 15000 tax credit proposal, you can only claim the credit if you have a tax liability, and only up to the amount of your liability.  Thus, if you did not have any tax liablity, you would not be able to claim the 15000 tax credit anyway.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Qun, sorry for the late response.   Yes, you should be able to qualify for the credit as long as you meet the other irs guidelines regarding eligiblity, such as income threshold and you have not had a primary residence in the past 3 years.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Jason,
You wrote the following:
Hi Sandra and Amy, the time period to be eligible for the credit is 04/01/2008 to 06/30/2009. Home purchases in Jan or Feb 2008 would not be eligible as I understand it. 

I bought my first house on 04/01/2008, do I qualify $7500  credit?

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have already e-filed my 2008 taxes and claimed the original $7500 &quot;credit.&quot;  If this item stays in the stimulus package, would I be eligible for the proposed increase to $15k and would I also be able to treat it as more of a true &#039;refund&#039; with no repayment requirements?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Omar,

You ask a very good question.   The last paragraph at http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc611.html regarding &quot;Special Election&quot;, allows you the opportunity to claim the credit on your 2008 taxes even though the home is bought after Dec 31st 2008 and before July 1st 2009.  However, you must have already bought the house to claim it.      If you&#039;re going to buy the house after April 15th, you may claim the credit on your 2009 taxes, or you may be able to file an extension on our 2008 taxes so you can still claim it on your 2008 taxes.   You may want to seek some guidance from a tax professional so you can weigh your options.    

Here is a paraphrase of the &quot;Special Election&quot; from the IRS publication:

&quot;Special election to treat purchase as made in prior year.

In the case of a purchase of a principal residence after December 31, 2008, and before July 1, 2009, a taxpayer may elect to treat such purchase as made on December 31, 2008. &quot;

For your reference, here is the offical tax form 5405  for claiming the credit:

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5405.pdf

You can see that line C gives you the option of applying the 2009 purchase to your 2008 taxes.

If you find out more on this issue, please post it here.

					<description><![CDATA[I plan to purchase a home May of this year (2009) Taxes have to be filed by April 15.  Do I request the credit now or do I have to wait until I file my 09 taxes?  Can you request the credit before you purchase a property?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Betty, if you&#039;re buying a newly constructed home, then your settlement date must be before June 30th 2009.  If you&#039;re buying an existing home, then you must occupy the new home by June 30th 2009.
