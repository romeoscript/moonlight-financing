This means that if your household income is $100,000, you can typically afford a home between $200,000 and $300,000.<\/p>\n<p>However, this <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight-mortgage-calculators\/\">calculation<\/a> isn\u2019t the best method. Why? Because it doesn\u2019t consider monthly expenses and debts. Those costs can make a huge impact on how much you can afford. Let\u2019s say you earn $100,000 a year and have $1,000 in monthly payments for student debt, car loans, and credit card minimum payments. In this situation, you won\u2019t have the same funds to pay your mortgage as someone earning the same income who doesn\u2019t have those debts.<\/p>\n<p>Before you start thinking about mortgage rates, put together a budget that tracks your ongoing monthly bills for all expenses: credit cards, car and student loans, work lunches, daycare, date nights, membership dues, subscriptions, vacations, savings, and so forth. See what\u2019s left over to spend on home ownership in moonlight like your mortgage, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, and community association fees, if applicable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your Down Payment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If make a down payment for at least 20% of the home\u2019s cost, the mortgage lender may not require you to get private mortgage insurance. That insurance protects the lender if you default and costs hundreds each month. The higher down payment you make, the lower your monthly payments will be \u2014 which leaves more money to make your mortgage payment.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, the lower your down payment, the higher the loan amount you\u2019ll need to qualify for and the higher your monthly mortgage payment. Also keep in mind if home prices or interest rates are rising, and you wait to buy until you accumulate a bigger down payment, you may end up paying more for your home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your Overall Debt<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mortgage lenders in moonlight usually follow the 43% rule. This means monthly mortgage payments covering your home loan principal, interest, taxes and insurance, plus all your other bills, like car loans, utilities, and credit cards, shouldn\u2019t exceed 43% of your gross annual income.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of how the 43% calculation works for a homebuyer in moonlight making $100,000 a year before taxes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your gross annual income is $100,000.<\/li>\n<li>Multiply $100,000 by 43% to get $43,000 in annual income.<\/li>\n<li>Divide $43,000 by 12 months to convert the annual 43% limit into a monthly upper limit of $3,583.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All your monthly expenses including your potential mortgage cannot be more than $3,583 per month.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible a lender will give you a mortgage with a payment above the 43% line. If they do, consider carefully before you take it. Evidence from studies of mortgage lending suggest that borrowers who go over the limit are more likely to run into trouble making monthly payments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Converting Rent to Mortgage Payment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The tax benefits of home ownership in moonlight generally allow you to afford a mortgage payment, including taxes and insurance, of about one-third more than your current rent payment without changing your lifestyle. In other words, you\u2019d multiply your current rent by 1.33 to arrive at a rough estimate of a mortgage payment.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say your rent is $1,500 per month. You should be able to comfortably afford a $2,000 monthly mortgage payment after factoring in the tax benefits of home ownership. However, if paying rent is straining your finances, you\u2019ll want to buy a home that will give you the same payment rather than going up to a higher monthly payment. Always remember your home purchase will have added overhead that your landlord now covers, like property taxes and repairs. If there\u2019s no room in your budget for those extras, you could become financially stressed.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>Owning a home in moonlight should make you feel safe and secure, and that includes financially.
