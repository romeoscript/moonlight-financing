Being prepared is the name of the game!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The holiday season will be over before you know it, and it will be time yet again for New Year\u2019s resolutions and house hunting season. If you\u2019ve thought that next year is the year you want to buy a new home, here are a few things you should be doing right now: <\/span><\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Save<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t already started saving, now is the time. Although there are many options for low down payment mortgages, especially for first-time homebuyers, <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moneyunder30.com\/how-much-cash-you-really-need-to-buy-a-home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the down payment is not the only expense involved in the purchase of a new home<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; there are closing costs, the costs associated with moving and the price of any improvements or repairs you want to make upon move-in. While traditional mortgages require a 20% down payment, there are options for loans that require as little as 3.5% down, however, closing costs can be another 2-3%, and then you\u2019ll have to set up an escrow account. Last, lenders don\u2019t like to see borrowers use every last dime up at closing, and usually require that you have some money left in the bank&#8211;at least enough to cover a couple months\u2019 worth of payments. <\/span><\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Get Your Credit in Order<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The better your credit score, the more likely you are to be approved for any loan, and a mortgage is probably the largest loan most people take out. According to <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.freddiemac.com\/news\/blog\/danny_gardner\/20151123_build_credit.html?attr=rssMFB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a recent post by Freddie Mac\u2019s VP, Danny Gardner<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the average credit score among homebuyers last quarter was 751, which represents a very reliable borrower. Gardner gives his advice for what you should be doing now to get your credit in order if you\u2019re thinking of buying next spring. His six easy steps include taking actions as simple knowing what your credit report says right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Make a Wish List<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making a wish list is not just fun, it\u2019s a great way to get focused as you prepare to shop for a home. Your realtor will need this information too, so they can narrow down the field to homes you would actually consider living in. In order to make your search as efficient as possible, make a list and separate it into categories like \u201cabsolutely must have,\u201d \u201cwould be nice, but not a deal breaker,\u201d \u201ccould take it or leave it\u201d and \u201cnot important.\u201d There are several tools on the web that will help you get started, like this <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/realtormag.realtor.org\/sales-and-marketing\/handouts-for-customers\/for-buyers\/worksheet-define-your-dream-home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">downloadable worksheet from RealtorMag<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Get Pre-qualified<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a difference between being pre-qualified for a mortgage and being pre-approved. A pre-qualification means a lender takes a look at figures that you provide about your income, debt and assets, and then estimates how much mortgage you can afford. It\u2019s totally free and there is no obligation. It\u2019s a great way to determine what price range you should stay within and what kind of monthly payments you can expect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To talk to a lender and be pre-qualified for a mortgage today, check out <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/\">lonestarfinancing.com<\/a><\/strong>. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The holiday season will be over before you know it, and it will be time yet again for New Year\u2019s resolutions and house hunting season.
