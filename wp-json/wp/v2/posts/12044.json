This quarter-percentage rate increase brought the federal funds rate into the target range of 2 \u2013 2.25 percent. The committee sets monetary policy, primarily by raising or lowering the Fed\u2019s target for the federal funds rate, which is used as the benchmark for a range of consumer interest rates.<\/p>\n<h1>What does the Federal Reserve do?<\/h1>\n<p>The Fed\u2019s actions have an indirect impact on the prices you pay at the grocery store, gas pump and other retail outlets. And, they also indirectly affect the job market.<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, the Fed fights inflation by raising the federal funds rate. This makes money scarcer and more expensive. When they do this, the intent is to reduce overall demand and slow the pace of price increases. However, raising the federal funds rate is less about fighting inflation and more about getting the rate closer to its long-term neutral of 3 percent to 3.5 percent.<\/p>\n<p>When the Fed raises the federal funds rate, it usually slows the economy because it costs more to borrow. People tend to borrow less, buy less, and it typically leads to fewer people being hired. They also have less leeway to demand pay raises. This lack of power to bargain for higher wages is seen as a way to fight inflation. When the Fed sends rates higher, it slows the economy and puts the brakes on inflation.<\/p>\n<h1>How will this affect my mortgage?<\/h1>\n<p>If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, you don\u2019t need to worry. As the name suggests, your interest rate is fixed and won\u2019t change over the life of your mortgage. And if you\u2019re shopping for a fixed-rate mortgage now, your interest rate probably won\u2019t be affected.<\/p>\n<p>However, credit cards, home equity loans, and adjustable-rate mortgages will become more expensive within weeks. That\u2019s because the rates for these products is usually tied to the prime rate\u2014which is affected by the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate.<\/p>\n<p>Since adjustable-rate mortgages are modified annually, you may feel the impact all at once. Just in 2018, rate hikes have increased average rates by about half a percent to 3.92%. For a homeowner with a $200,000 mortgage, their monthly payments increase by around $50. This quarter-point rate increase will likely tack on an additional $30 to a homeowner\u2019s monthly payment.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to interest rates, the Fed plays other roles that can affect mortgage rates. For example, in 2017 the Fed began gradually shrinking the bond portfolio it amassed during and after the financial crisis. This attempt to lower long-term rates likely has a bigger effect on fixed rate mortgage loans.<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, housing economists predicted rising mortgage rates. However, they\u2019ve been reasonably steady in spite of the three Fed rate hikes in 2018. Mortgage rates have steadily climbed since the beginning of this year, which goes to show the central bank\u2019s actions aren\u2019t predictive.<\/p>\n<h1>Actions to Consider<\/h1>\n<p>If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, you might consider refinancing into a fixed-rate loan. Adjustable-rate mortgages that are due to change in the next year or two have the potential to begin squeezing homeowners\u2019 budgets.<\/p>\n<p>Even though rates are going up, a fixed-rate mortgage at today\u2019s rates is likely to save the borrower money when compared to what they\u2019d be paying after adjustable rates increase. After all, there\u2019s no telling when the Fed will raise rates again.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based mortgage company that can help you through every step of financing your new home.
