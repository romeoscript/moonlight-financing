It\u2019s incredibly important to\u00a0know what you are purchasing.\u00a0Having a certified home inspector conduct an\u00a0inspection\u00a0should\u00a0be compared to taking out an insurance policy against all potential operating costs.<\/p>\n<p>There are different types of home inspection processes that you may want completed\u00a0before the purchase of a home. First and most importantly, you\u00a0want\u00a0a general or residential inspection performed on the home. A home may look move in ready, but an inspector will cover features of the house such as\u00a0the roofing, electrical,\u00a0plumbing,\u00a0HVAC, insulation,\u00a0ventilation,\u00a0as well as structural features of the home and may unveil issues that are not readily noticeable. Once the inspection is completed, the home inspector will generally provide the buyer with a report suggesting any improvements or repairs deemed necessary to bring the\u00a0home up to current standards.\u00a0Home inspections may often reveal problems with a home that could be pricey to fix.<\/p>\n<p>However, a home inspector\u2019s standard practice typically does not\u00a0usually\u00a0include the following, for which a specific license to inspect and identify may be required:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asbestos<\/li>\n<li>Radon, Methane, Radiation, and Formaldehyde<\/li>\n<li>Wood-Destroying Organisms\u00a0(this requires a licensed pest control technician)<\/li>\n<li>Mold, Mildew, and Fungi<\/li>\n<li>Rodents<\/li>\n<li>Lead<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Home Inspection Checklist\u2014Items Needing Service<\/h1>\n<p>Home inspection reports do not describe the condition of every component if it\u2019s in excellent shape, but should note every item that is defective or needing service. The serious problems are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health and safety issues (within reason)<\/li>\n<li>Roofs with a short life expectancy<\/li>\n<li>Furnace or A\/C malfunctions<\/li>\n<li>Foundation deficiencies<\/li>\n<li>Moisture or drainage issues<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Prepare for Professional Inspection<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Foundation: Look at the base of the walls and the ceilings in each room. Are there obvious cracks or apparent shifts in the foundation? Do the same around the outside. Are there any trees encroaching on the foundation?<\/li>\n<li>Lot: Does the drainage appear to be away from the house? Are there any obvious soggy areas?<\/li>\n<li>Roof: What is the overall condition? When was it last replaced?<\/li>\n<li>Exterior: Does the house look like it will need repairs or repainting soon? Are gutters and downspouts firmly attached? Are there loose boards or dangling wires? Is there asbestos in the exterior material, which would require added costs if it needed to be repaired or replaced?<\/li>\n<li>Attic: How does the interior of the roof structure look? Are there any signs of leaks?<\/li>\n<li>Interior evidence of leaks: Check ceilings and around windows in each room.<\/li>\n<li>Basement\/Crawlspace: Is there dampness? Adequate insulation?<\/li>\n<li>Electrical: Do the switches work? Are there any obvious malfunctions? Have the outlets been grounded? Is the panel updated and expandable for additional appliances or a potential remodel?<\/li>\n<li>Plumbing: Any unusual noises or malfunctions? Has the sewer line been scoped to check for potential cracks?<\/li>\n<li>Appliances: If these are included, what is the age and condition of the stove, dishwasher or refrigerator?<\/li>\n<li>Heating\/cooling system: Does it seem to do the job? How old is the furnace? If the system has been converted, are the old systems or tanks still in place?<\/li>\n<li>Odor: Does the home smell? Can you detect what it might be and whether it could be fixed? Beware of musty odors which could signal a hidden water leak.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plan on being present for the inspection.\u00a0Your\u00a0agent should be right there with you the entire time. Chances are the seller\u2019s agent will be there, too, to help get any quick answers the inspector might need. Block off the entire morning or afternoon. Home inspections take time and you don\u2019t want to rush through it. During this time, follow along as much as you can.\u00a0Take notes if needed. Ask questions you feel are necessary.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re not being bothersome. Inspectors will explain your home\u2019s systems and give you maintenance tips. Those should also be in the final report, along with pictures, but\u00a0hearing and seeing\u00a0as the inspection is in progress is\u00a0helpful. The day of inspection will probably feel like a whirlwind of activity.<\/p>\n<p>After you receive the detailed findings,\u00a0you should\u00a0evaluate\u00a0and decide if any issues are\u00a0deal-breakers, such as serious structural defects. You may\u00a0choose to repair\u00a0minor fixes yourself to avoid nitpicking with the seller. For\u00a0intermediate issues,\u00a0such as water-damaged carpet, discuss\u00a0with your agent. You can\u00a0make terms with the seller to\u00a0pay for repairs or give credit at closing so that you can choose the contractors and materials you prefer.\u00a0An inspection will make you fully aware of exactly what your dollars are buying you and is just as much an investment as the property itself.<\/p>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight based mortgage company, and specialize in FHA home loans for first time home buyers.
