It stands for TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule. The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) both resulted in disclosure forms that were required to be provided to borrowers before closing on their homes, but because these two forms were created separately, they didn\u2019t mesh well, and they confused borrowers and slowed down the process while lenders tried to break all this disclosure language down for consumers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first part of TRID combines these two forms into the Loan Estimate; one form that explains all the costs and risks they are about to take on. The CFPB requires that lenders provide this form to borrowers at most, three business days after they apply for a home loan. The second part of TRID takes\u00a0two disclosure forms pertaining to the closing of the loan, and combines them into one form called the Closing Disclosure. Again, this form is intended to tell\u00a0consumers, in plain language, about all the costs associated with closing the loan. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this integration is meant to educate, inform and protect borrowers, but anytime a sweeping change is made to a process that involves so many entities &#8211; not just borrowers and lenders, but also banks, title companies, realtors, appraisers &#8211; there is going to be an adjustment period. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve only just entered that adjustment period, with TRID taking effect on October 3, 2015, so it\u2019s hard to say exactly how it has affected things, but financial experts have been predicting longer closing times, at least at first. Terry Moore, the Senior Managing Director at Accenture Credit is quoted in <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.housingwire.com\/articles\/35255-what-does-a-post-trid-world-look-like\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">HousingWire<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201c\u2018For at least the next several months, it is likely that borrowers will have to wait several days longer to close on their homes.\u2019\u201d Moore says the average right now is about 45 days to close. Everyone involved in the process will have to adapt\u00a0to the new timeframes and the new requirements, or there could be big delays when\u00a0one piece of the puzzle doesn\u2019t quite fall into place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore does point out that these new disclosure regulations will ultimately simplify, clarify and aid consumers in \u201cavoiding unpleasant surprises at the closing table,\u201d so in the long run, it\u2019s worth these growing pains, when\u00a0you consider that the last housing bubble burst, in part, because some consumers were uninformed about, and unprepared for, the risks they were taking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"
