There\u2019s a lot to learn and a lot to do, which can leave quite a bit of room for mistakes. The home buying process is an emotional experience that is personal for each buyer. Just remember that when your emotions are involved in a purchase, you might end up <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/blog\/2018\/08\/01\/survive-buying-house%C2%B6\/\">skipping or overlooking<\/a> certain details. Here are some suggestions to keep in mind during the process.<\/p>\n<h1>Know What You Can Afford<\/h1>\n<p>What the bank says you can afford and what you know you can afford or are comfortable with paying are not necessarily the same. If you don\u2019t already have a budget, make one. If you end up looking at homes that are outside your price range, you can put yourself in the dangerous position of trying to stretch your budget beyond your means\u2014or cause you to feel unsatisfied with what you can actually afford.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that while creating a budget you discover you can\u2019t afford the type or size of home you initially desired and that you should reduce monthly expenses and\/or increase your income before you even start looking. When calculating this figure use a mortgage calculator, easily found online, to research current interest rates. This will give you an estimate of what your total mortgage payments will be.<\/p>\n<h1>Insist on an Inspection<\/h1>\n<p>You should plan to be present during the inspection. Your agent should be right there with you the entire time. Chances are the seller\u2019s agent will be there, too, to help get any quick answers the inspector might need. Block off the entire morning or afternoon. Home inspections take time and you don\u2019t want to rush through it. During this time, follow along as much as you can. Take notes if needed. Ask questions you feel are necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Your dream home might appear to be move in ready, but an inspector will cover features of the house such as the roofing, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, insulation, and ventilation. The inspector will also review structural features of the home and may unveil issues that are not readily noticeable. Once the inspection is completed, the home inspector will provide the buyer with a report suggesting any improvements or repairs deemed necessary to bring the home up to current standards. Home inspections may often reveal problems with a home that could be pricey to fix.<\/p>\n<h1>Safeguard Your Identity<\/h1>\n<p>Identity theft remains the fastest growing crimes in the United States. Many criminals posing as loan officers try to get you to provide your personal information\u2014including your social security number and date of birth\u2014up front. A reputable company will be able to give you a rate and payment quote before you give them your personal information. By keeping your personal information secure you accomplish two things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You keep your credit score stable by avoiding unnecessary credit inquiries<\/li>\n<li>Your personal information (date of birth, social security number) will only be provided when necessary<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Don\u2019t Get Ripped Off<\/h1>\n<p>Have you been tempted to apply to a \u201cget multiple quotes from different lenders\u201d website? Don\u2019t give in to the temptation. These organizations often sell your information to dozens of different mortgage brokers who will continually contact you for weeks trying to convince you to finance with them. That\u2019s probably not the experience you were looking for when you started researching moonlight home loan options. So, do your homework and find a few reputable lenders to work with (like <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/blog\/2018\/03\/01\/top-ten-reasons-use-mortgage-broker\/\">Lone Star Financing<\/a>) instead of falling prey to the gimmicks of information brokers.<\/p>\n<h1>Budget for All Home-Related Costs<\/h1>\n<p>You\u2019ll want to take all the time you need to budget out your next few years. Planning for payments, renovations, and repairs will make a huge difference in your long-term success as a homeowner and help prevent unexpected hits to your budget.<\/p>\n<p>Many people mistakenly believe that after the <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/blog\/2017\/12\/18\/know-home-closing-costs\/\">closing costs<\/a> and down payment, the only monthly home-related costs are the mortgage payments. But that\u2019s not the case\u2014there are many other housing-related costs to remember, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest on your mortgage<\/li>\n<li>Property taxes<\/li>\n<li>Homeowners insurance<\/li>\n<li>Additional hazard insurance<\/li>\n<li>Homeowners association (HOA) fees (and other related fees)<\/li>\n<li>Utilities (water, power, trash, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Maintenance costs<\/li>\n<li>Repair costs<\/li>\n<li>Furniture, appliances, flooring, paint, carpeting, decorations, curtains, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All these costs can add up very quickly, and many new homeowners find themselves unprepared. Some of these costs will surface (or resurface) long after the entire mortgage is paid off, like utilities and property taxes. Yes, there are some money-saving tax deductions you can claim as a homeowner; however, those deductions aren\u2019t quite as significant as advertisements would have you believe. Deductions won\u2019t offset interest on the mortgage loan or the other basic costs of home ownership.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based mortgage company that can help you through every step of financing your new home.
