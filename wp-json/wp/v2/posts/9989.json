If your credit score isn\u2019t very high, the home buying process can stall even before it truly begins. One of the first considerations of home ownership is figuring out your finances, and that includes understanding your credit\u2014a critical piece of the buying process. Whether you\u2019re preserving a high score or your credit requires an overhaul, now is the time to address your creditworthiness to get the best mortgage at the best rate.<\/p>\n<h1>Why your credit score is so important<\/h1>\n<p>Your credit score is usually referred to as a FICO score. This three-digit number, ranging from 300 \u2013 850, is used to determine if you are a good credit risk. Your score is determined after taking each of the following five sections of your credit report and weighing them according to a set standard.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Payment history: 35%<\/li>\n<li>Outstanding debts: 30%<\/li>\n<li>Length of your credit history: 15%<\/li>\n<li>Types of credit you\u2019ve used: 10%<\/li>\n<li>Amount of new credit: 10%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Less than perfect credit does not mean you will never own a home, but you\u2019ll pay higher interest rates, which means you\u2019ll pay more over time\u2014that\u2019s what makes repairing your credit worth it. You want to be able to qualify for the lowest possible interest rate, which will save you on your monthly payments as well as the total cost of ownership.<\/p>\n<p>When your score falls below approximately 650, problems arise. If your score runs beneath that number, efforts should be taken to clean up your report and raise your score. This includes eliminating inaccuracies on your reports, paying off whatever outstanding debts you can, and assuring your monthly payments are made on time. A year\u2019s worth of on-time payments will raise your score and show a mortgage lender that you are responsible.<\/p>\n<p>Figure out where you are right now<\/p>\n<p>Obtain a copy of your credit report. If you don\u2019t have a current one, get your credit report now. You need to be aware that problems exist before you can solve them. Serious issues, and sometimes even minor ones, can take months to repair. There are numerous ways to get your report, and you\u2019re entitled to a free one from each of the three credit bureaus once a year under the FACT Act; go to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.annualcreditreport.com\/index.action\">Annual Credit Report website<\/a> to get your credit score for free. Remember, Federal law allows you to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get a free copy of your credit score report every 12 months\u2014from each credit reporting company.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that all the information on each of your credit reports is correct and up to date.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Mistakes happen\u2014get them fixed<\/h1>\n<p>Every year, a whopping twenty-five percent of people looking for a mortgage in moonlight had errors in their credit report. When you spot inaccuracies, it\u2019s up to you to fix them. Your credit report will have instructions\u2014and you can find step-by-step guides on how to file a claim on any of the credit bureau websites. Follow the steps precisely. Keep records of your dispute, including copies of any documents you file with the bureaus. Within thirty to sixty days of your initial claim, you should get a response.<\/p>\n<h1>Always pay your bills on time<\/h1>\n<p>If you want to increase your credit scores over time in a clear, steady, upward climb, never miss a payment. Some say the best way to keep you score afloat is to avoid carrying a balance that\u2019s more 50% of your limit on each card, so pay those debts down below that halfway mark as soon as possible. Always make more than the minimum payment on your revolving credit each month; a history of only minimum payments is not a positive indicator. When you pay more, not only do you reduce your balances faster, but you save money on the total amount of interest paid.<\/p>\n<h1>Don\u2019t move it, lose it<\/h1>\n<p>Credit card companies have caught on to consumers who try to reduce balances by shifting debt between low or zero interest cards, and while they\u2019ll still let you do it, they\u2019ll charge you hefty fees. Don\u2019t just move debt to a different credit account\u2014pay off the balance on your existing cards. Incurring the extra cost is just not worth the alleged benefits.<\/p>\n<h1>Avoid major purchases<\/h1>\n<p>Any consequential buys can alter your financial picture. Banks balk at sudden credit score changes just before approving a loan. Avoid changes your finances right before a home purchase. That means no big purchases on credit, like buying a car or charging an expensive vacation.<\/p>\n<h1>Be prepared<\/h1>\n<p>It\u2019s simply not possible to have your credit clean and clear in a matter of days. It takes time\u2014sometimes months or even years. Pay down your debt, then don\u2019t use your credit cards until your credit score has been checked and you have been approved for your Transcope Mortgage. Even with a clean report, you should confirm that your credit cards are paid up prior to qualifying for a loan. That, of course, requires planning and budgeting.<\/p>\n<h1>Conclusion<\/h1>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to put in the time and effort to clean up your credit reports, whether you\u2019re ready to enter the home buying market in moonlight tomorrow or in a few years.
