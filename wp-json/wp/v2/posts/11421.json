But then you realize you\u2019d rather save your money for a dream vacation and said house doesn\u2019t come with the amenities you love at your apartment, like an on-site gym, pool, and doggie day care.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t make snap decisions and assume you need to buy a house. Here\u2019s some truth talk: You might not be ready to buy. It\u2019s a long-term commitment that requires strong financial standing, and in many ways it\u2019s about more than just money.<\/p>\n<h1>You don\u2019t make enough money<\/h1>\n<p>You might think you make enough money to buy a home, but you need to consider more than just your mortgage payment. You need both upfront and ongoing money. This includes having enough for the down payment and closing costs \u2014 and enough left over for an emergency fund. Your salary will need to be enough to pay for mortgage interest and principal, HOA fees, homeowners insurance, and taxes. These costs, according to many financial planners, should be less than 28% of your gross income.<\/p>\n<h1>You\u00a0have\u00a0to worry about maintenance, repairs, and other uncertain costs<\/h1>\n<p>When you rent a home, the payment tends to increase steadily over time, but this is the only uncertain cost you have to worry about. When you own a home, you have to do your own maintenance, or pay someone else to do it for you. You\u2019ll have to cut your own grass, fix your own toilets, paint the outside of the house, etc. Plus, there are the big-ticket items that need to be replaced occasionally, like a new roof or HVAC system.<\/p>\n<h1>Your debt is too high<\/h1>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you do make enough money to afford to buy a house and make your monthly mortgage payments. You also need to factor in any debt you might have. If all your credit cards are maxed out, you want to get those bills under control before considering homeownership. Lenders typically want your total debt, which includes your potential mortgage payment, to be less than 36% of your gross income.<\/p>\n<h1>You don\u2019t have enough money in savings<\/h1>\n<p>If you\u2019ve accumulated the funds for a down payment, congratulations! You\u2019ve accomplished one of the more difficult steps, but unfortunately, you\u2019re going to need more than that. If the home or property needs an emergency repair, do you have the cash on hand to cover the costs \u2014 or would this unexpected event send you into debt?<\/p>\n<p>You should also consider those costs that aren\u2019t necessarily unexpected, but which you might not have considered. You need money for closing costs and the first few months\u2019 mortgage payments, applicable taxes, and closing costs. You\u2019ll probably also want new furniture and perhaps some new decorations for your new home. As you can see, you don\u2019t want to drain your savings on just the down payment.<\/p>\n<h1>You haven\u2019t been on the job long enough<\/h1>\n<p>Most mortgage lenders like to see that you\u2019ve been working the same job for at least two years. In fact, they calculate your average income based on your job history for the last 24 months. Being on the job that long shows a certain stability and changing jobs or having an income gap signals insecurity. For example, moving from salary to commission-based pay may cause your income to fluctuate and can add to uncertainty about your readiness to buy.<\/p>\n<h1>You have\u00a0bad credit<\/h1>\n<p>A bad credit score indicates some sort of financial problem, such as skipping out on paying a bill or two, filing for bankruptcy, or carrying too much debt. Obtain and thoroughly examine your credit report before making a decision to buy. If your scores are low, mortgage lenders will have questions about payments, loans, or other debts and may make suggestions that could require time to resolve. If it\u2019s going to take 6 \u2013 12 months or longer to repair, then you are not ready to buy.<\/p>\n<p>Having little or no credit history can also be problematic. Occasionally lenders will use other means to grant a loan \u2014 such as rental history, car insurance, utilities, monthly subscription services, and cell phones. Lenders want a pattern of good credit with those companies for 12 months or longer. But mortgages such as these are rare.<\/p>\n<h1>You\u2019re unsure what type of home you want<\/h1>\n<p>You might have thought only about buying a single-family home, but you have more options than you might think. For example, you could purchase a duplex and help pay for that mortgage by earning some rent money: live on one side and rent out the other. A condo or townhome may have similar amenities to apartment living and make the transition easier.<\/p>\n<h1>You\u2019re unsure of time commitment<\/h1>\n<p>Unless you know you will remain in the area for the next three to five years, you\u2019re not ready to buy. If you buy a house and have to sell the next year, you\u2019re likely to lose money because appreciation won\u2019t catch up to the closing costs and expenses during that short time period. If your job security is unstable or you\u2019re considering moving a few hours away to be closer to family, it\u2019s wise to hold off on buying a home.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based mortgage company that can help you through every step of financing your new home.
