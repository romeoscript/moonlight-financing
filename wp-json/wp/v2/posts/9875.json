And what could mark the anniversary of such an occasion better than a few pyrotechnics?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than the barbecue spread, of course. <\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But fireworks safety is is even more important than picking your sausage\/rib\/brisket ratio, believe it or not! And there are a few things you\u2019ll need to be sure of before you head out with your Roman candles, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackcatfireworks.com\/where-to-buy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Cat <\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">branded goodies, and so forth. Here\u2019s a quick rundown. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the weather conditions? <\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Obviously we don\u2019t mean \u2018Is it rainy or clear?\u2019 \u00a0We hold those factors to be self evident. But if there\u2019s been a drought in your area and everything\u2019s windy and dry, you might want to hold off. The beauty in fireworks is that they fade quickly. Wildfires on the other hand&#8230;not so much.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have the right set up?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one told a certain 10-year-old that firing a bottle rocket with a too-short stick from Mom\u2019s vase didn\u2019t so much result in a fireworks display as it did in a broken vase. Similarly, no one told a certain twenty-something that a TNT style model in a too-short ceramic pot doesn\u2019t so much shoot <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as&#8230;<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">out. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grabbing the right \u2018works off the interstate before the rush is all well and good, but for a real send off, you want to make sure you\u2019ve got sturdy ramps! moonlight got that right with NASA. Now we can get it right in our own homes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you in the right? <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With great power comes great bureaucracy. And with a great new home comes new state, county, and neighborhood rules! While we all know the sun isn\u2019t going anywhere until past 8, and that we love our neighbors and their fun in this great state, you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> butt up against some ordinances that aren\u2019t quite what you\u2019re used to. Make sure to read read read the laws in your area as well as the terms of your HOA and plan your celebrations accordingly. We want the red white and blue in your driveway in flag form&#8230;not police car form. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you playing it safe? <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the food covered up? Are all the small hands accounted for and monitored? Is the sweet tea refreshed and not watered down? These are all important factors with any backyard fun, but where there\u2019s fireworks, or even just sparklers, you also want to make sure everyone knows where the exits, water, and any damp towels are just in case. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Protip for first time homebuyers\u2014now that you\u2019re out of the apartment renters game, you\u2019ll need to purchase and keep tabs on your own fire extinguishers!<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Your new home is an investment!
