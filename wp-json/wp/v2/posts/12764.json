And LED bulbs can save even more\u2014if you have about 40 incandescent light bulbs in your home running just a few hours a day, you\u2019ll spend about $360 a year just on those bulbs. With LED bulbs, you\u2019ll spend about $55\u2014that\u2019s a hefty savings that adds up over time.<\/p>\n<p>Most buyers expect to see programmable thermostats these days, and they can save you money by installing one. A savings of $180 per year in heating and cooling costs is Energy Star\u2019s estimate.<\/p>\n<p>Consider a water heater retrofit with a high-efficiency water heater. A tankless water heater saves you 24% \u2013 34% on your water heating costs if you use less than 41 gallons of water each day in your household. If you use more than this daily your cost savings will be lower but still 8% \u2013 14% over traditional style water heaters.<\/p>\n<h1>Conclusion<\/h1>\n<p>If you plan to update or remodel, focus your efforts on smaller projects that make your home more appealing to budget-minded buyers.
