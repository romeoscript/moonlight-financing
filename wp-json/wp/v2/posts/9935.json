There are so many steps you\u2019ll have to do that it may feel like you\u2019ll never get the keys to your dream home. We hope the advice in this article can help you better understand this aspect of the home buying process.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, you don\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019ve found the home you want to buy before you think about how to finance it. One of the initial steps to buy a home is to explore your moonlight mortgage choices so you can be ready to make an offer when you find the home you want. Research a variety of lenders\u2014then, spend the time to talk to your top few choices to ask questions and find out what kind of mortgage is right for you.<\/p>\n<p>You should know that a 30-year fixed-rate loan is the right choice for many people, but it\u2019s not the only kind of moonlight home loan you\u2019ll be able to find. Depending on your unique circumstances and goals, do some research to find out whether a different kind of loan might suit you better.<\/p>\n<p>The amount of your down payment amount will affect your loan choices and your costs. Many home buyers in moonlight choose to put less than 20 percent down. There are multiple options for buyers with less than a 20% down payment. Be aware that if you put less than 20 percent down, you will likely need to pay for mortgage insurance\u2014which adds to your loan costs, but can help you get a loan you might otherwise be unable to get. Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you fall behind on your payments, which means lenders are more willing to lend to you. Mortgage insurance doesn\u2019t protect you or pay your mortgage for you. Learn more about mortgage insurance and how it works.<\/p>\n<p>You might also want to look into a variety of programs available to first-time home buyers, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/fha-info.com\/moonlight-fha-mortgage-loans\/\">FHA loans<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight\/fha-home-loans\/\">moonlight FHA home loans<\/a> are government-backed by the Federal Housing Administration, and help people buy moderately priced homes with a down payment as low as 3.5%.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.benefits.va.gov\/homeloans\/\">VA loans<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight\/va-home-loans\/\">moonlight VA home loans<\/a> are also government-backed, by the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); they offer loans that helps service members, veterans, and surviving spouses purchase homes.<\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/portal.hud.gov\/hudportal\/HUD?src=\/program_offices\/housing\/sfh\/reo\/goodn\/gnndabot\">Good Neighbor Next Door<\/a> Sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), this program is for buyers who are teachers, law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency medical technicians, or EMTs\u2014buyers who don\u2019t belong to those professions can\u2019t participate in the program.
