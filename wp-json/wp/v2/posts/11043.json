With no deadlines to meet, no schedules to keep, no one to answer to, retirement means time to travel, engage in hobbies there was never time for, write the novel you always had on the back of your mind\u2014time to finally unwind and relax.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are still bills to pay and that\u2019s unavoidable, including your mortgage, taxes, utility payments, car payments, insurance. None of them vanish just because you retired. How will you use the money you\u2019ve spent your life saving for retirement? Do you have a plan? Do you want the convenience of being able to walk to shops, restaurants, and other community hubs? Are you looking for flexibility, fewer homeowner responsibilities, and expenses along with \u00a0the idea of simplifying your next move? Do you perhaps want to be closer to children and grandchildren, or live in a warmer climate?<\/p>\n<p>Frequently retiring seniors find themselves house heavy, meaning they\u2019re living in a house far larger than they actually require. A larger home means more upkeep, large costs for that upkeep and usually higher property taxes. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/wm-scott-page\/think-small-and-dwell-dow_1_b_8110936.html\">contribution<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/wm-scott-page\/think-small-and-dwell-dow_1_b_8110936.html\"> to the Huffington Post<\/a> explores ways seniors can save more and spend less through downsizing.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most commonly given pieces of advice to retirees is to move to smaller home. A smaller house means reducing energy costs, costs associated with maintenance, and less maintenance in general. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.niche.com\/places-to-live\/search\/best-cities-to-retire\/\">Relocating<\/a> not only to a smaller home, but to an area with lower property taxes, help seniors living on a fixed income make the most of their savings. Purchasing a smaller home after the sale of the larger one will also add funds to retirement savings.<\/p>\n<p>For those who are retiring and reviewing options about where to live, consider renting vs. buying. Building equity is one of the biggest factors that favors purchasing a home. But if there are no plans to leave the home behind or buy another home, it usually makes more financial sense to rent.<\/p>\n<p>Though renting can be a better option for those who don\u2019t plan to stay in one place for very long, buying is a more stable option over the long haul, because you don\u2019t have to worry about sudden rental increases. Also, if you choose to leave an inheritance, having the property to inherit or sell is taken care of.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve paid off your mortgage, selling your house for a less-expensive condo means that you\u2019ll have a big chunk of cash at your disposal. This could be used to supplement your retirement income stream or fund long-awaited extracurricular activities. Even if you haven\u2019t paid off your mortgage, you may be able to reduce or eliminate a high monthly payment. Though condos may carry additional fees, many of the upkeep costs are covered\u2014so it just depends whether you\u2019d rather pay more upfront, or as things come up.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there\u2019s the trend of micro-homes, which are homes that are typically as small as 100 \u2013 400 square feet. The tiny home movement is more than just a relocation; it\u2019s a lifestyle change that encourages increased efficiency and less waste\u2014and maybe retirement is the perfect time to consider something like that. Simplifying can be liberating, and that is what retirement should be all about. Plus, many tiny homes are built on trailers, allowing you the freedom to travel and take your home with you without the exorbitant expense of an RV.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based mortgage company that can help you through every step of financing your new home.\u00a0Fill out the quick contact form or call Lone Star Financing today at 1-800-960-4565 to speak with one of our Transcope Mortgage specialists\u00a0and\u00a0get a free good faith estimate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It sounds so satisfying, in a way, the prospect of working your whole life and then retiring\u2014it\u2019s a goal most of us have, to reach for a reward for decades of toil.
