There&#8217;s no universally correct answer to this question, but one option may be a much better choice for you. For some, homeownership was a no-brainer. Here are the top reasons to think about when buying a home, and how to determine whether or not you may be ready to buy yours.<\/p>\n<h1>Freedom to customize<\/h1>\n<p>When you purchase a home, you\u2019ll be able to make it yours. When you rent, it can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to customize or make improvements. Many landlords won\u2019t even let you mount art, much less paint the walls.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you own your home, the sky is the limit when it comes to customization. Want to build a fence so your dog can run around? Go for it. Is your dishwasher outdated, leaky, or ineffective? If you own, you don\u2019t have to wait for your landlord to replace it, and you can pick the new one yourself.<\/p>\n<h1>Costs start to add up<\/h1>\n<p>Once you move in, costs can add up. You can anticipate painting and new furniture\u2014so be sure to put aside some money for it. Yes, you just bought the home and you\u2019re enjoying that excitement, but you also need to keep in mind there are other costs besides just the mortgage. Here\u2019s a look at an example of some of the expenses you may have to pay for when you move in.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>$1,000 \u2013 painter<\/li>\n<li>$500 \u2013 dining table<\/li>\n<li>$350 \u2013 dining table chairs<\/li>\n<li>$2,600 \u2013 couch<\/li>\n<li>$1,500 \u2013 new blinds<\/li>\n<li>$300 \u2013 side table<\/li>\n<li>$100 \u2013 new light bulbs<\/li>\n<li>$500 \u2013 miscellaneous kitchen \/ bathroom stuff<\/li>\n<li>$200 \u2013 supplies for minor repairs<\/li>\n<li>$100 \u2013 cleaning supplies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>What you can\u2019t prepare for<\/h1>\n<p>Once you\u2019re moved in, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll notice a few small things that annoy you or needed repairs. Like the standup shower might be leaking, you want to switch to LED lightbulbs, or a door handle only opens when turned upwards.<\/p>\n<p>The shower probably just needs some new caulking. If you\u2019ve never done anything like this, you might be a bit intimidated by that kind of repair job. But re-caulking is a simple job and easy to do on your own. With the door handle it may not be working properly. Installing a new one is pretty painless.<\/p>\n<p>The light bulbs are obviously a personal preference, but you can see how all these small tasks can add up and become pretty time consuming. It required multiple trips to various stores, and if you\u2019ve never done it before you have to research and do the repairs on your own.<\/p>\n<h1>We aren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon<\/h1>\n<p>In order for home ownership to make sense, you&#8217;ll probably need to stay put for at least a few years. While you don\u2019t pay any real estate commissions when you buy a home, you\u2019ll probably pay around 6% when you sell.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you pay $250,000 for a house, you\u2019ll need to sell it for almost $266,000 just to break even. Since real estate prices have historically risen by about 3.5% per year, you should be able to break even after about two years. However, since the housing market is somewhat unpredictable, plan on staying put at least 3 \u2013 5 years. Otherwise, you\u2019re probably better off renting.<\/p>\n<h1>A great time to buy your \u201cforever\u201d house<\/h1>\n<p>Thirty to thirty-five years ago, a mortgage had an interest rate of 18%. Even if you had good credit, rates approaching 20% were common in the early 1980s.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve all heard how low mortgage rates are, but this really puts it into perspective. Today\u2019s 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates are about 3.5%, and they are unlikely to get much lower. This means that you can finance a $200,000 home with 20% down for a monthly principal and interest payment of $718. At 18% interest, that payment would more than triple to $2,411.<\/p>\n<p>18% mortgage rates aren\u2019t going to make a comeback anytime soon, but 3.5% rates won\u2019t stick around forever either. So even though you may not need all of the space in our house just yet, if you\u2019re a growing family, lock in a cheap rate and buy your forever house.<\/p>\n<h1>Other financial considerations<\/h1>\n<p>Even if buying a home costs as much or more each month than renting, there are other financial considerations to take into account. Obviously, owning your home allows you to build equity over time\u2014if you get a $200,000, 30-year mortgage at 4% interest, your monthly principal and interest payment will be about $955.<\/p>\n<p>However, keep in mind that $288 of your first mortgage payment will go toward paying down the principal\u2014effectively putting money back in your pocket. Furthermore, because of the way loan amortization works, the amount of principal being paid off each month will increase over time.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, there are numerous tax benefits to owning your home. If you itemize deductions, you can write off your mortgage interest and property taxes each year, as well as any mortgage insurance you pay if your income is under a certain limit. The bottom line is that even if it\u2019s more expensive to buy, it could still make good financial sense over the long run.<\/p>\n<h1>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/h1>\n<p>Admittedly, there are some good reasons for renting. We\u2019ve already mentioned that if you don\u2019t plan on staying in the same place for more than a few years, you&#8217;re probably better off waiting to buy until your situation becomes more permanent. Or, if you don\u2019t want to worry about the uncertain expense of home maintenance, renting can be the better option.<\/p>\n<p>The point is that some people are better off renting, while others can benefit greatly from homeownership. You have to do your research and decide which option is the best for you and your goals for the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What\u2019s better, renting or buying?
