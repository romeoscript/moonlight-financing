In August 2019, the FDIC and OCC signed off on the rule, but were still waiting on the Fed to approve the rule change as well. Now, the Fed has also given the rule change its stamp of approval, and with all three agencies signing off, the appraisal rule change will soon go into effect.<\/p>\n<h1>What do the new rules mean?<\/h1>\n<p>The new rules do not apply to loans wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by, or eligible for sale to, a government agency or government-sponsored agency. meaning loans sold to or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac would still require an appraisal, per each agency\u2019s rules.<\/p>\n<p>Be aware the rule does not fully exempt the relevant home sales from any type of appraisal-type action. As written the final rule \u201crequires institutions to obtain an evaluation to provide an estimate of the market value of real estate collateral.\u201d Also the evaluation must be \u201cconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\u201d The rule establishes that an evaluation \u201cshould contain sufficient information and analysis to support the regulated institution\u2019s decision to engage in the transaction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This change will have a sizable impact on the real estate market, as according to the OCC, the new rules apply to approximately 40% of home sales. According to the FDIC, the agencies estimate that increasing the appraisal threshold from $250,000 to $400,000 would have exempted an additional 214,000 residential mortgages from the agencies\u2019 appraisal requirement in 2017, representing 3% of total HMDA originations.<\/p>\n<p>On a percentage basis, under the current rules, in 2017, there were 750,000 transactions that were exempted from the appraisal requirement (56%). By increasing the threshold to $400,000, there would have been an additional 214,000 sales exempted from the appraisal requirement (an additional 16%). Therefore 72% of the eligible transactions would be exempted from the appraisal requirement, while 28% would still require an appraisal.<\/p>\n<p>The rule responds, in part, to comments that the previous exemption level for residential transactions had not kept pace with price appreciation in the residential real estate market. According to the FDIC, those commenting in support of the rule stated that an increase would be appropriate given the increases in real estate values since the current threshold was established in 1994. Other commenters stated that the increase would provide \u201cburden relief for financial institutions without sacrificing safe and sound banking practices.\u201d On the other hand, commenters opposed to the rule change stated that the proposal would \u201celevate risks to borrowers, financial institutions, the financial system, and taxpayers.\u201d<\/p>\n<h1>A controversial decision<\/h1>\n<p>According to the final rule, many commenters opposed to an increase in the threshold argued on behalf of appraisers, stating that appraisers are \u201cthe only objective and unbiased party in a transaction and bring checks, balances, and oversight to the mortgage lending process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other commenters noted that the rule could have an outsized impact on certain consumer groups, such as low-income individuals, members of certain minority groups, or first-time homebuyers, because those borrowers are more likely buy homes in the lower price range, and would, therefore, be more likely to buy a home without an appraisal.<\/p>\n<p>Despite those comments, the agencies all approved the rule, which also received support from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Accordingly, and in light of the Threshold\u2019s likely cost savings for consumers as a whole; existing consumer protections, including those for certain at-risk consumers; and the current market practices of often using appraisals rather than evaluations even in cases where appraisals are not required under the Banking Agencies\u2019 appraisal regulations, the Bureau has determined that the Threshold would not be likely to expose consumers to an unreasonable risk of harm, and the Bureau concurs that the Threshold provides reasonable protection for consumers who purchase 1 \u2013 4 unit single-family residences.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last November, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve released a proposal that would increase the appraisal requirement for home sales from $250,000 to $400,000, meaning that certain home purchases of $400,000 and less would no longer require an appraisal [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":12781,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[104],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.3 (Yoast SEO v19.11) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Will you need an appraisal?
