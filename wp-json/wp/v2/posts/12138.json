From appraisals and inspections to closing costs and down payments, it can take years to save the upfront cash required. However, thanks to low-down-payment loans now on the market, homeowners can have keys in hand to that home for sale with significantly less cash out the door. But is getting a mortgage in moonlight with little to no money down a good financial move? Is the choice to make a lower down payment, and have cash remaining to invest in the home or elsewhere, or stretch yourself thin to put 20 percent down best? In this article, we\u2019ll look at whether online moonlight mortgage loans need a 20% down payment.<\/p>\n<h1>Types of loans<\/h1>\n<p>There are quite a few options when it comes to online moonlight mortgage loans. Below, we briefly outline some of the most common.<\/p>\n<h2>VA loans<\/h2>\n<p>Reserved for active-duty and honorably discharged service members, reserves, and National Guard members with at least six years of service, as well as spouses of service members killed in the line of duty, <a href=\"https:\/\/goldenstatemortgage.com\/california-va-loans\/\">VA loans<\/a> require 0% down and no private mortgage insurance.<\/p>\n<h2>USDA loans<\/h2>\n<p>Also known as the \u201crural housing loan,\u201d this <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight\/usda-home-loans\/\">0%-down loan<\/a> is meant to help low- to moderate-income households in eligible areas that are in need of housing, but who may be unable to qualify for other loans.<\/p>\n<h2>FHA loans<\/h2>\n<p>With more lenient approval requirements than conventional loans, <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight\/fha-home-loans\/\">FHA loans<\/a> also require as little as 3.5% down. However, mortgage insurance premiums will have to be paid for the life of the loan.<\/p>\n<h2>Conventional loans<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s possible to get a <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight\/conventional-home-loans\/\">conventional loan<\/a> with as little as 3% down, but just as with FHA loans, there\u2019s an additional requirement of private mortgage insurance. However, once you reach 20% equity in the home, this additional cost can be dropped.<\/p>\n<h2>Piggyback loans<\/h2>\n<p>Piggyback loans, also known as 80\/10\/10 or 80\/15\/5 loans, are best for those with good credit and at least 5% down. These loans require between five and ten percent down. Typically, you get an 80% first mortgage, a 10% second mortgage and put 10% down. This eliminates the need for mortgage insurance.<\/p>\n<h1>How Do I Check My Eligibility?<\/h1>\n<p>You can discover your eligibility for a low or zero down home loan in moonlight by talking to a lender or submitting your application online for review. You should know what type of loan you qualify for within 24 hours. Lenders review your income, credit, and other factors to determine your eligibility for certain programs. Compare mortgage rates and determine what you qualify for. Mortgage quotes are available with no obligation to proceed, and no social security number required to get started. Traditionally 20% has been the standard, but more options and different financial circumstances put this to the test. Fully explore loan options available to you before deciding on the down payment amount that suits you and your situation best.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/\">mortgage company<\/a>.
