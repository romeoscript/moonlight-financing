Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on eligibility, you should find a rebate check in your mailbox sometime in May. Individuals with adjusted gross income of less than $75,000 can expect up to $600 and couples with adjusted gross incomes of less than $150,000 can expect up to $1,200.\u00a0 If you make more you will see less or nothing at all. Additionally, families can expect to receive $300 for each child 17 or younger who lived with them for at least half of 2007.<\/p>\n<p>Good news\u2026 those of you who did not receive a stimulus check in 2008, based on your 2007 return, you may now qualify for a recovery rebate check. This will be based on your 2008 earnings that you file in 2009. Parents who welcomed a child in 2008 may be eligible. Of the many changes since the revision to the original proposal, one of the biggest may surprise those who paid no income taxes.\u00a0 They may receive $300 as long as they earned at least $3,000.\u00a0 Again, you will need to file your tax return to determine eligibility. Who else is eligible for the stimulus package rebate checks?\u00a0 Social Security recipients, disabled veterans, and recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are scheduled to receive a one-time payment of $250.<\/p>\n<p>The twist in this rebate is that the government will not automatically send you a check even if you qualify. In order to receive your check, you must claim this rebate on your 2008 tax return. Many are recommending using some type of tax software to prepare your return. Software such as TurboTax automatically alerts the user if they qualify and guides them sep-by-step.<\/p>\n<p>There is more to this package than just rebate checks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homeowners:\u00a0 A tax credit of 30% (or up to $1500) of the cost of energy-efficient improvements such as windows, furnaces and air conditioners in 2009 and 2010 is available.\u00a0 Energstar.gov has more details.<\/li>\n<li>New car buyers: Whether you itemize or not, you can now deduct sales tax paid on new (not used) cars and light trucks purchased after February 17, 2009 and before January 1, 2010. A one-year deduction for state or local sales or excise tax paid on new car purchases up to $49,500 is available. The interest you pay each year on the loan is not deductible.<\/li>\n<li>Homebuyers: \u201cFirst-time\u201d homebuyers, those who have not owned a home in the past three years \u2013 who purchase on or after January 1, 2009 and before December 1, 2009 &#8211; are eligible for the $8000 tax credit. Eligibility is set at $75,000 adjusted gross income for single taxpayers, and $150,000 for couples filing jointly.

Families who don&#8217;t earn enough to pay income tax could still get up to $1,000 in extra tuition help. Under the stimulus plan, computer expenses will now be considered an allowable expense for 529 College Savings Plans.\u00a0 One wrinkle\u2026the new credit can\u2019t be collected until filing a tax return in 2010.

Currently all unemployment payments are taxed.<\/li>\n<li>COBRA Benefits: If you have been laid off, you may better afford health coverage because the stimulus package slashes 65% of the cost of maintaining insurance through a former employer. The subsidy would lower the cost of COBRA premiums to about $130 a month for single coverage and $350 a month for a family.\u00a0 Additionally, this subsidy is for up to nine months.<\/li>\n<li>Making Work Pay tax credit: The stimulus package asks employers to withhold less tax. Eligible employees may receive 6.2% of earned income up to a maximum credit of $400 ($800 for two-earner couples).\u00a0 And what is the bottom-line?\u00a0 Some employees may pocket an extra $12 to $20 per weekly paycheck.\u00a0 This depends entirely on whether the government pays it out over six months or more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The 2009 stimulus package is full of tax savings for you and your neighbors.\u00a0 So, the next time someone asks, \u201cWho is eligible for the stimulus package?\u201d the answer just might be\u2026 you!<\/p>\n<p>More information on tax provisions and credits can be found at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.taxfoundation.org\/publications\/show\/24338.html\">http:\/\/www.taxfoundation.org\/publications\/show\/24338.html<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Christine Andreski<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So the stimulus package has been signed\u2026 and many taxpayers are asking,  \u201cWho is eligible for the stimulus package?\u201d  Are you eligible for its benefits?
