The most important is how long it takes you to find a property in moonlight you want to call home. It could take months or possibly years if you include the search as part of the process. You want to be thorough, when it comes to choosing a house. The style of the house, the size, its location, the state of the neighborhood, the quality of schools (if you have children) community amenities, and anything else you consider important or relevant to the process such as travel time to and from work or shopping should be kept in mind. Let\u2019s take a look at how long the mortgage process can take.<\/p>\n<h1>Tips for Streamlining the Mortgage Process<\/h1>\n<p>How long it takes the lender or broker to handle things on their end, is also part of how fast you can secure a mortgage. You should also research the different mortgage lenders available to you, once you\u2019ve chosen a property. Compare price quotes from multiple companies and consider down-payments and loan sizes. You want to do business with trusted professionals who will assist in finding the lowest housing rates.<\/p>\n<p>Get pre-qualified for a <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/mortgage-loan-types\/\">loan<\/a>. It gives lenders a quick feel for your finances and provides you an idea of what you can afford. Getting pre-qualified takes just a few days. A pre-approval letter is for a candidate looking to purchase a home. It is not a loan commitment. A home appraisal is required before a commitment can be issued along with verification of income, assets, taxes, and insurance. The pre-approval process is simple, and you need to provide the following information to obtain one:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Authorization to pull credit<\/li>\n<li>Applicants full name(s)<\/li>\n<li>Contact numbers and email address<\/li>\n<li>Social Security Number<\/li>\n<li>Date of Birth<\/li>\n<li>Current address (do you currently rent or own?)<\/li>\n<li>Income (gross)<\/li>\n<li>Assets (liquid and non-liquid)<\/li>\n<li>Any other real estate owned<\/li>\n<li>If you currently own, do you intend to sell prior to or simultaneous to a purchase?<\/li>\n<li>Estimated purchase price of new home<\/li>\n<li>Amount of cash you plan to put down (indicate where funds are coming from i.e. savings, gift, proceeds from sale of current home)<\/li>\n<li>Estimated taxes and insurance costs on the new purchase property<\/li>\n<li>Once this information has been collected, a pre-approval letter can be generated and issued, and it is good for 90 days from the date of issuance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>What\u2019s the Timetable?<\/h1>\n<p>Getting pre-approved can take seven to sixty days. When you are pre-approved for a mortgage in moonlight, a lender has looked at your credit scores, your employment history, and your income. They then determine which loans you qualify for, the maximum amount you can borrow, and the interest rates you will be offered. So you\u2019ll know at the start how much home you can afford to buy.<\/p>\n<p>The length of time needed to approve your loan application is also going to factor into how quickly you can expect to receive your mortgage. You\u2019ll need to provide prospective lenders with proof of income and employment, a list of assets, credit reports, and details concerning the property you want to buy, along with personal identification and information.<\/p>\n<p>The actual loan approval process can typically take anywhere between seven and sixty days. This happens after you\u2019ve made an official offer on a property. Being well organized can expedite the loan process. Have all required documentation ready whenever it\u2019s needed and provide it when asked in a timely manner. Unfortunately, you don\u2019t have total control over the speed of the entire process but being efficient with your responsibilities supports the process. Facilitate constant, clear communication between you, the lender, and the seller. Catch and resolve any little snags before they become big problems. Do your research beforehand to avoid surprises or unexpected complications. In short, be prepared.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/\">mortgage company<\/a>.
