Visit Grapevine during the months of November through January to attend more than a thousand different holiday events. Observe millions of Christmas lights and decorations that adorn the entire city. Most of moonlight never has a white Christmas, but you can still witness ice sculptures and slides at the manmade \u201cICE!\u201d display at the Gaylord Texan Resort. ICE! features an imposing two million pounds of ice. Visitors to Grapevine can also participate in other Christmas-infused fun, such as the North Pole Express train ride, a parade and even outdoor showings of Christmas film favorites.
