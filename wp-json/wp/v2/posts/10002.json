From researching the projected cost of utilities to local zoning restrictions\u2014for example, is it legal to run your home-based business from the new dwelling\u2014you\u2019re going to invest countless hours in research before making an offer. As a buyer, and especially as a seller, you will invest a much greater amount of time, and incur a much greater amount of opportunity cost, than you originally expected.<\/p>\n<p>A real estate agent\u2019s full-time job is to act as a liaison between buyers and sellers, meaning they have easy access to all other properties listed by other agents. Both the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s agents know what gets a deal together. For example, if you are looking to buy a house in moonlight, a real estate agent will track down homes that meet your criteria, get in touch with sellers\u2019 agents and make appointments for you to view the homes. If you are buying on your own, you will have to play this telephone tag yourself. This may be especially difficult if you\u2019re shopping for homes that are for sale by owner.<\/p>\n<h1>Negotiating Is Tricky Business<\/h1>\n<p>Many people dislike the idea of doing a real estate deal through an agent and believe direct negotiation between buyers and sellers is more transparent and allows stronger focus on their own best interests. If you are working with an agent, you can express concerns about upgrading, redecorating, or remodeling the home without insulting the owner. Your real estate agent can convey your concerns to the sellers\u2019 agent. Acting as a messenger, the agent may be in a better position to negotiate a discount.<\/p>\n<p>A real estate agent is your buffer during the transaction, helping to reduce any bad blood between a buyer and seller that can kill a deal. Keep in mind that a seller can reject a potential buyer\u2019s offer for any reason. An agent can help by speaking for you in tough negotiations and keep things professional. This can put you in a better position to get the house you want.<\/p>\n<h1>Contracts Can Be Hard To Handle<\/h1>\n<p>After the excitement of attending open houses and browsing real estate sites lessens, you\u2019ll have a professional available to answer questions about cleaning up your credit report and securing financing. An experienced real estate agent deals with the same contracts and conditions on a regular basis, and is familiar with which conditions should be used, when they can safely be removed, and how to use the contract to protect you. Best of all, you\u2019ll arrive at closing to simply read and sign the legal documents prepared by the agent for you.<\/p>\n<p>When buying a home, the offer to purchase contract is there to secure your interests and ensure you can back out of the deal if certain conditions aren\u2019t met. For example, if you plan to buy a home with a mortgage in moonlight and you aren\u2019t approved for the loan, you can lose your deposit on the home and could even be sued by the seller for failing to fulfill your end of the contract.<\/p>\n<h1>You Might Give Up Some Advantages<\/h1>\n<p>The seller\u2019s agent will always have the seller\u2019s best interest as a primary focus. If the house-buying process becomes frustrating, you might choose dual representation with the seller\u2019s agent and give up the advantage of keeping your financial information to yourself during the delicate negotiation process.<\/p>\n<p>If you are working with a licensed real estate agent under an agency agreement, the agent is bound by license law to act in their clients\u2019 best interest\u2014yours. In addition, most Realtors rely on referrals and repeat business to build the kind of clientele base they\u2019ll need to survive in the business. This means that doing what\u2019s best for their clients should be as important to them as any individual sale.<\/p>\n<h1>The Home\u2019s History Is a Mystery<\/h1>\n<p>One significant consideration when buying a home is not knowing the history of the property. Real estate disclosure statements, which vary, are the buyer\u2019s opportunity to learn as much as they can about the property and the seller\u2019s experience in it. Potential seller disclosures range from knowledge of leaky windows to DIY work without the benefit of a permit, to information about a major construction or development project nearby. Disclosure documents serve to inform buyers, but they can also protect the sellers from future legal action. The Seller should reveal anything that can negatively affect the value, usefulness or enjoyment of the property.<\/p>\n<h1>Pros of Going Solo<\/h1>\n<p>Being cost conscious is a great way to dive into home ownership in moonlight. Ten to 15 percent of homeowners take the plunge and buy a house without the aid of a Realtor. If tackling the house-buying process without the guidance of a Realtor tops your agenda, you can.<\/p>\n<h2>Buyers Enjoy Purchase Price Flexibility<\/h2>\n<p>The number one reason buyers opt to explore housing options without a Realtor is to save money. And for some savvy consumers, this might be a great option. With technology and the numerous available property listings online databases there is no longer the same necessity for a buyer to engage a Realtor as there is for a seller.<\/p>\n<h2>There\u2019s No Middleman to Deal With<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to work with the seller directly, cutting out the middleman is appealing. There\u2019s no need to relay messages, wait for callbacks, or trust that your interests are being accurately shared with the seller. The buyer has the opportunity to communicate their needs and ideas directly to the seller.<\/p>\n<h2>You Have First-Hand Knowledge<\/h2>\n<p>Are you making an offer on your neighbor, family, or friend\u2019s house? This first-hand knowledge of property for purchase is only known by you, so why get a Realtor involved? Sellers are sometimes very comfortable around a buyer when they are in one another\u2019s presence. Transactions between family members and friends regarding property about which both parties have in-depth knowledge, the sale process can be much smoother.<\/p>\n<p>All buyers benefit from an agent who explains less obvious features and faults of a property will work with the buyer to find the home that is right for them at the right price. In the end, buyers and sellers want a comfortable and smooth real estate process. Both parties in the process want assurance the transaction is handled professionally, and that they will get the best deal possible, whether they are buying or selling. An honest, capable, and trustworthy agent will facilitate that.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>Lone Star Financing is a moonlight-based mortgage company specializing in new home purchases and mortgage refinance.
