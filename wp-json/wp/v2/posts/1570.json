Many are also looking at buying a first home as more of an investment than a first step toward settling down.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much of the advice geared toward single homebuyers is basically the same advice you\u2019d hear whether you are single, married, have kids or don\u2019t have kids: e.g., shop around for a good mortgage rate, make sure you can afford the monthly payment, don\u2019t forget to account for the additional expenses that come along with homeownership etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are some unique considerations single\u00a0homebuyers may face, so here, we\u2019ll take a look at those as well as advice from the experts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coldwell Banker agent Jessica Edwards tells Time Money, when buying a house on your own, be sure\u00a0<\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/2894989\/single-and-thinking-of-buying-a-home-heres-some-advice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have a trusted friend you can talk to about this big decision<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Everyone will have advice, and that can be overwhelming. Having one or two people you can run your decisions by, who will tell you if it sounds like a good idea can be extremely useful. We all know what it\u2019s like to have a million different scenarios swimming around in our heads. You\u2019ll need to find a way to sort through all of them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to this point, as a single, independent person, you may not have had much \u201ctying you down.\u201d Becoming a homeowner changes that. Realtor.com reminds singles buying a home to\u00a0<\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.realtor.com\/advice\/going-solo-home-buying-tips-for-one\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">think about what may be ahead for them<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0down the road. A home is a long-term investment, so think about whether the home you choose will still work for you five or ten years down the road. Are you planning to stay in this area for a while? Could there be any additions to your family in that time? You may not know exactly, but trying to get out of a mortgage just a year or two later means you may not even recoup the costs you spent on closing. Consider whether the home you\u2019re purchasing would make a good rental property, in case you do have a big change and decide not to stay in it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, be sure to take advantage of programs for first-time buyers in your particular financial and personal situation, whatever that may be. Most states have programs to help you on your way to becoming a homeowner. For example, the My First moonlight Home program offers special mortgage\u00a0<\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tdhca.state.tx.us\/homeownership\/fthb\/available_funds.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assistance for down payments and closing costs<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0to moonlight homebuyers. You can also find resources for first-time homebuyers from the FHA, which\u00a0<\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/portal.hud.gov\/hudportal\/HUD?src=\/program_offices\/housing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aims to expand homeownership opportunities<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0and lists available resources for homebuyers by state on their site.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step you make toward buying a home should be to talk to an experienced mortgage lending expert. They can help you determine how much you need to put down, your monthly payments and the best type of loan for you.
