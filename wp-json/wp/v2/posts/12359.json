In a 2016 survey from the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and VantageScore Solutions found that more than 80% of consumers know the basics of credit scores, but may not be aware of some very important details. Let\u2019s take a look at what you need to know about your credit score.<\/p>\n<h1>Five things to know about your credit score<\/h1>\n<p>First, beware of fraud. If someone opens a credit account in your name or incurs a large amount of credit debt. Keep an eye on your score regularly to watch for changes you did not anticipate.<\/p>\n<h2>1. A credit report is different from a credit score<\/h2>\n<p>A credit score is calculated based on information in a credit report, whereas a credit report is a stand-alone document. Calculated using the information on your credit reports, such as details of your credit accounts, how often you apply for credit, debt collection accounts and some public records, are how credit scores are. Make sure you are comparing the exact same score and that you know the range, if you want to know if your credit is improving. Wherever you obtained the score should provide that information. 750 on another scoring model, for example, is not necessarily equivalent to a 750 FICO score.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Free scores and reports<\/h2>\n<p>Annually, each of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, must provide you with a free copy of your credit report. You can also obtain your credit score for free from different places. Many websites offer this service.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Checking your own score<\/h2>\n<p>The effect of hard inquiries, when a lender looks at your credit when you apply for a loan or credit card, does negatively impact your scores, but the impact is small and temporary.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Joint accounts<\/h2>\n<p>The account activity will be reflected on both your credit reports, if you open a loan or credit card with another person. Be aware of who is responsible whenever you share credit and who is affected if a payment is missed as joint accounts are different than authorized users.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Negative information eventually goes away<\/h2>\n<p>Negative information ages off your report and no longer affects your score after 7 years, but different kinds of negative information, like a bankruptcy, will remain on your credit report for different periods of time.<\/p>\n<h1>Common credit questions<\/h1>\n<p><strong>How do you build credit? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, new credit and credit mix, are the five fundamentals that determine your credit score. A general rule is to use credit sparingly and make payments on time. It takes years to build good credit, but it\u2019s worthwhile to be patient.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is your score calculated?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Payment history, credit utilization, average credit age, account mix, and inquiries. Payment history accounts for about 35% of your credit score. Approximately 30% of your credit score is based on the amount of debt you\u2019re currently carrying which means the amount of money you currently owe to your creditors. Roughly 15% of your score, is for the length of your credit history. Then 10% of your credit score considers a healthy mix of credit accounts, different types of accounts, including credit cards issued by a retail store, home equity lines of credit, auto loans, etc. The final section accounts for 10% whenever you apply for credit from a lender, a hard inquiry (explained below) posts to your credit report.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is it ever too late to build credit? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No! Your credit score can affect you for your entire lifetime, so it\u2019s always worth trying to improve.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do student loans impact your credit? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Late or missed payments will always affect your score negatively.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you get credit when no one wants to give it to you? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find a secured credit card or one designed for people with bad or no credit. Use it sparingly and make the payments on time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a good credit score? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The commonly used FICO score gives a range of 350 to 800, with 800 being the very best score you can receive and 350 being the lowest. 700 or above is considered a \u2018good\u2019 credit score.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the impact of a low credit score?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The lower your credit score, the more likely you are to pay higher interest rates on things like credit card balances and mortgages,.<\/p>\n<h1>Credit Scores Aren\u2019t the Only Things That Matter for Lending Decisions<\/h1>\n<p>When reviewing applicants, a credit score isn\u2019t the only thing lenders consider. You may be able to secure a loan through an alternative lender, if you have no credit or poor credit. In some situations, making a personal appeal or giving a lender more context to your credit report can help you access their loan programs.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/\">mortgage company<\/a>.
