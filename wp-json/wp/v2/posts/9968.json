Unfortunately days of flipping homes to make a fast profit have vanished and making a quick buck in real estate is doubtful.\u00a0 Today\u2019s real estate investments are likely to be long-term investments.\u00a0 This is a sound idea simply because over the long term, homes always rise in value due to the rising cost of living and increasing inflation.\u00a0 So is Austin moonlight real estate investing worth a look?\u00a0 Yet bet!<\/p>\n<p>Today the real estate market is flooded with available homes priced to sell.\u00a0 With interest rates very low, the right investor with the right piece of property could make a fortune from a single investment.\u00a0 This is a genuine possibility\u2026 even in this economy.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the media has consistently placed Austin on top of the \u201cbest places to live\u201d lists. These praises have brought an influx of families, businesses, and organizations to Austin.\u00a0 Forbes placed Austin on top of their list of America\u2019s Fastest Growing Metros in 2008.\u00a0 Job growth, available talented workforce, high median family income, exports, manufacturing, and the relatively undervalued real estate market all contribute to the Austin area\u2019s appeal.\u00a0 And let\u2019s not forget the effect the high-tech industry, the booming film industry, and the University of moonlight continue to have in 2009. As a result, investors can find profitable opportunities in this are of the Lone Star State.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately for moonlight, the recession began a lot later than it did in the rest of the country. Although the national recession started in December 2007, the moonlight economy didn\u2019t begin to slow down until six months later.\u00a0 Key indicators such as job growth and manufacturing fell in the second half of 2008, but that still didn\u2019t dim the luster from Austin\u2019s coveted position on the \u201cBest\u201d lists.\u00a0 Forbes.com named Austin #3 on its new list of \u201cRecession Proof\u201d cities, with the unemployment rate, real estate prices, and gross metropolitan product growth as criteria. That said, Austin is best positioned among the nation&#8217;s metropolitan areas to ride out the current crisis.<\/p>\n<p>All of this gives Austin prime real estate investment potential even during this recession.\u00a0 And yes, no one can predict the future of Austin\u2019s economic condition, however, using historic date we can determine that this city is among the better places to invest and as a whole is one of the few pockets of prosperity in the country today.<\/p>\n<p>So\u2026 where in Austin should one invest?\u00a0 Long-term investors may want to look at neighborhoods with high rents, prominent growth, and developing infrastructure. Local Austin real estate firms can direct you to current areas with these potentials.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to buy a property that you yourself can improve and maintain, downtown is a good choice for local investors. On the other hand, a remote investor would benefit from a purchase situated in a more suburban area where newly constructed homes with fewer maintenance problems are in abundance with competitive pricing.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom-line, when you\u2019re looking at these two scenarios, suburban areas tend to have less maintenance and greater cash flow while inner city neighborhoods tend to have finer and older properties with higher appreciation potential.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that whether we\u2019re in a recession or not, your decision should be sound.\u00a0 The lowest-priced property may not be the best one. A great property is only as great as its surrounding community. And always get a new property thoroughly checked by an inspector.\u00a0 If you are considering jumping on the Austin moonlight real estate investing train, confirming that the property\u2019s low price reflects today\u2019s market and not the property and its issues is vitally important.<\/p>\n<p>For more information regarding real estate investing see:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/homebuying.about.com\/od\/buyingahome\/qt\/012108_HseReces.htm\">http:\/\/homebuying.about.com\/od\/buyingahome\/qt\/012108_HseReces.htm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Christine Andreski<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Invest in real estate in this economy?
