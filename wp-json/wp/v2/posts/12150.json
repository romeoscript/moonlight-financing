This isn\u2019t true at all. There are programs that work with lenders to assist in providing a home to those whose credit needs some work. In this article, we\u2019ll look at the two main programs the best mortgage lenders in moonlight use for home buyers without perfect credit. They are FHA (Federal Housing Administration) and VA (Veterans\u2019 Affairs) loans.<\/p>\n<h1>FHA Loans<\/h1>\n<p>FHA insures first-time purchaser loans and is a part of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. It assists individuals with low income to borrow money for home ownership. As a borrower, you would need to pay mortgage insurance to protect the interest of the mortgage lenders in case of defaults. <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight\/fha-home-loans\/\">FHA home loans<\/a> come with the most attractive interest rates since the loan is insured by the FHA.<\/p>\n<p>Low minimum credit score requirements make this an ideal program for first time buyers. A mortgage with mere 3.5 percent down payment it likely for those with a credit score of 580 or higher. A ten percent down payment is mandatory for those with a score of 500 \u2013 579. Individuals with a score of 500 or less normally don\u2019t qualify, but the FHA will consider some difficult cases with unusual credit history or poor credit scores who meet other requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind the FHA is not a lender itself. To obtain an FHA loan, you\u2019ll want to work with the best mortgage lenders in moonlight who are an FHA approved lender. FHA acts merely an insurer and not a lender. That\u2019s why you need to work with a Transcope Mortgage lender, and not the FHA.<\/p>\n<h1>VA Loans<\/h1>\n<p>Similar to FHA loans, the Veterans Administration (VA) is not a lender itself. The VA guarantees the loans, giving lenders extra assurance lending to veterans is a good decision. A VA loan requires no down payment and PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) is not required. Additionally, though most lenders will look at credit scores, the <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight\/va-home-loans\/\">VA loan program<\/a> itself has no credit minimum which assists veterans with limited resources or poor credit an opportunity to become property owners.<\/p>\n<p>Basic VA service requirements for this program are: 90 consecutive days of active duty service, 181 days of active duty service during peacetime, six or more years in the Reserves or National Guard Active-duty Service. Discharge from service because of hardship, reduction in force, certain medical conditions, or a service-connected disability can waive the above requirements. Individuals dishonorably discharged do not qualify for this program.<\/p>\n<p>Lenders will want proof their loans in made in good faith and the borrower is a financially lower risk in other areas such as; a low debt to income ratio, no late mortgage payments in the past three years, no late payments to other creditors in the last year and five or more consecutive years of proof of income at one employer. If a reasonable set of circumstances can be explained to the lender regarding the low credit score, loss of a job, illness or death in the family, a loan may still be considered.<\/p>\n<p>Neither of these programs guarantee a mortgage but give those with less than optimal credit options to become a homeowner.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/\">mortgage company<\/a>.
