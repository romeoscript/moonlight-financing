Many Texans have reverted to the goal of paying off their house and getting rid of their mortgage.<\/p>\n<p>Doing the Math &#8211; Refinancing into a shorter-term mortgage isn&#8217;t a strategy for everyone, however.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing a shorter term usually means you&#8217;ll get a better rate &#8212; and you&#8217;ll pay much less interest over the life of the loan &#8212; but a shorter timeframe ramps up monthly mortgage payments significantly.<\/p>\n<p>For example, with a 4.5% interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $200,000, you would have a monthly payment of $1,015, including principal and interest. That same monthly payment jumps to about $1,480 with a 4% interest rate on a 15-year fixed-rate loan.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if the refinancing borrower&#8217;s current 30-year loan has a higher rate, the difference between the monthly payments could be less. Still, you should count on some increase in monthly payments.<\/p>\n<p>Is a 15 year mortgage right for you? Homeowners shouldn&#8217;t take on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage unless they have substantial savings, including at least a year&#8217;s worth of living expenses in liquid accounts. Also, it is recommended he recommends having a debt-to-income ratio below 35%. So if you have a gross salary of $5,700 per month, for instance, your monthly debt &#8212; including any mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, homeowners-association dues as well as auto and student loans and credit-card debt &#8212; would have to be a max of $1,995 to get a 35% ratio.<\/p>\n<p>Option to 15 year mortgage &#8211; Make That Extra Payment<\/p>\n<p>Borrowers who don&#8217;t meet those standards, or are worried about future loss of income, might be better served taking a longer-term mortgage but making extra payments to the principal to pay off the loan faster.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you refinance a $200,000 mortgage into a 30-year loan with a 4.5% rate, and then apply $100 of the savings to the principal payment each month, you&#8217;d save $31,700 in interest over the life of the loan. And you would pay off the mortgage in 25 years, instead of 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>sponsored ads: <a title=\"Propane Gas Woks \" href=\"http:\/\/www.discgrill.com\">Outdoor Propane Gas Woks <\/a>and Plow Disc Cookers from DiscGrill.com<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Historically low mortgage rates are allowing homeowners to pay down their mortgages at a faster rate &#8212; even if it means a substantial jump in their monthly payments. moonlight home owners are doing the math and realizing that rates have fallen enough so the increase in payment between a new 15-year mortgage and their current [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.3 (Yoast SEO v19.11) -
