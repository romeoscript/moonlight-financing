Everyone is talking about them, now that they\u2019re entering their 30\u2019s and they\u2019ve overtaken the Baby Boomers in numbers. <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/samanthasharf\/2015\/08\/24\/what-is-a-millennial-anyway-meet-the-man-who-coined-the-phrase\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Though the term \u201cmillennial\u201d was coined nearly a quarter century ago to define the generation born after Gen X<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it wasn\u2019t used much until pretty recently. Now, the word is associated with tech savvy multi-tasking young adults with short attention spans. Just hearing it mentioned conjures up images of smart phones, selfies and social media posts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As millennials enter young adulthood, they\u2019re making a major impact on the economy. They have plenty of debt, like enormous student loans. And although many people use the term millennial as a pejorative term to describe someone who is young, lazy and entitled, they\u2019re a generation who entered the job market at the end of a recession, so they understand what it\u2019s like to face fierce competition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millennials are also facing pretty stiff competition in the housing market. Those who don\u2019t want to pay today\u2019s extremely high rents are taking a unique approach to home buying. According to <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/millennialmoney\/2015\/04\/15\/why-millennials-are-better-at-home-buying-than-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Lucy Mueller for Forbes<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sentimentality is less of a factor when it comes to millennials buying homes. First, they don\u2019t see buying a home as the next step after marriage; many of them are opting to buy a house instead of plan a large wedding. Second, they\u2019re in it for the short term. Their first home isn\u2019t necessarily the one they\u2019re going to settle down in and raise a family. It\u2019s more like their first investment home that they\u2019re going to make improvements to and then sell for a profit in a couple years, so they can upgrade. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because they are going for what are considered investment properties &#8211; homes in up and coming urban neighborhoods that need a little work &#8211; they\u2019re in competition with flippers, who buy homes, improve them and turn them for a profit professionally. These professional flippers are not first-timers, and, as Mueller points out, they\u2019re coming to the table with\u00a0cash. No matter how good your credit is, or whether you\u2019re pre-approved or not, it\u2019s hard to beat a cash offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these challenges, some millennials are jumping right in, and they\u2019re finding that a lot of lending institutions have programs for first-time home buyers that require smaller down payments. Not to mention, some of the stricter requirements that took hold after the housing bubble burst are starting to loosen again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Check out what options are available to first-time home buyers at <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">lonestarfinancing.com<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Millennials are the \u201cit\u201d demographic these days.
