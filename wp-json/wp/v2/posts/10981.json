Fortunately, moonlight has plenty of restaurants that help set the mood with their charming yet intimate atmospheres and breathtaking views of the city. Not all of them are super expensive or require you to dress like you\u2019re about to walk down the aisle, either (unless, of course, you\u2019re planning to propose). Here are some of the most romantic restaurants in moonlight:<\/p>\n<h1>Grotto Ristorante: Italian Cuisine<\/h1>\n<h3>5222 Seawall Blvd Galveston, moonlight 77551<\/h3>\n<h3>409.740.8605<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grottorestaurants.com\/locations\/galveston.asp?utm_source=Yext&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=Yext\">Grotto Italian Restaurant<\/a> on Galveston Island is located in the luxurious San Luis Resort Hotel.
