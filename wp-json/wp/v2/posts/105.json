His plan stabilizes the faltering housing market by allowing millions of families to refinance or restructure their at-risk mortgages. Those facing foreclosure and those who have \u201cplayed by the rules,\u201d and continue to struggle with their house payments see this program as a ray of hope.<\/p>\n<p>The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan is the administration\u2019s lifeline to struggling homeowners with basically two options. The first option targets those owing up to 105% of their home\u2019s worth, thus qualifying them for low-cost refinancing. The second option targets those who have missed a payment or who are at risk of doing so because their mortgage is more that 31% of their gross monthly income. This second group of homeowners, may qualify for loan modification. For these struggling homeowners, applications for assistance became available on March 4.  Refinancing remains available until June 2010 and loan modifications are available until December 31, 2012. <\/p>\n<p>As with any plan there are restrictions in place.  The only qualifying home loan is a primary residence.  Real estate investment property is exempt.  A property with up to four units qualifies IF one of those units is the owner\u2019s primary residence.<\/p>\n<p>The refinancing component of the mortgage rescue plan essentially allows lenders to waive the 80% loan-to-value ratio, usually required for a refinance, with the following restrictions:<br \/>\n\u2022 Your current mortgage must be a \u201cconforming\u201d  loan held by government-sponsored mortgage entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which own or insure about half of the nation\u2019s $12 trillion in mortgages.<br \/>\n\u2022 The mortgage needs to be less than $417,000 (or the $729,750 cap in Los Angeles, New York, and other high-cost areas).  You\u2019ll need to call your lender to find out if your loan conforms.<br \/>\n\u2022 Your payment history must be in good standing with no more than one 30-day late payment in the past 12 calendar months.<br \/>\n\u2022 You are able to pay the new monthly payment.<br \/>\n\u2022 Your new monthly payments do not exceed 31% of your gross monthly income.<\/p>\n<p>The low-cost refinance will be most attractive to homeowners whose current mortgage is:<br \/>\n\u2022 A fixed-rate mortgage \u2013 at least 6.5% &#8211; and the savings from a lower mortgage rate allows the homeowner to recoup the closing costs in 24 months or less.<br \/>\n\u2022 The homeowner has an adjustable mortgage rate that is likely to adjust to a significantly higher rate before a future sell.<\/p>\n<p>So what about those homeowners who are able to pay their monthly payments but their home is worth less than their mortgage? Unfortunately, there is nothing risky about owing more than your home is worth\u2026 that is, unless you need to sell the property quickly or you are looking for a home-equity loan.  Real estate experts are suggesting improving the property to add value until you are ready to sell.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are homeowners whose property value is upside down \u2013 and refinancing is unlikely. There are also homeowners who really can\u2019t afford their payments but don\u2019t qualify under the mortgage rescue plan.  Experts are advising these unfortunate homeowners to talk to their lender and ask about other options such as deed-in-lieu (of foreclosure) or short-sale. Call before you fall behind in payments.  The loss-mitigation department should work with you since foreclosure may hurt the lender. <\/p>\n<p>For more information on the mortgage rescue plan please see:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.ustreas.gov\/press\/releases\/tg33.htm<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On March 4, 2009, President Barack Obama announced a $75 billion mortgage rescue plan providing affordable mortgage terms for countless American at-risk homeowners.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[79,72,56,102,55],"tags":[106,59,107,108],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.3 (Yoast SEO v19.11) -
