Cool off in one of our many magnificent swimming holes, of course.<\/p>\n<h2>Hamilton Pool Preserve (Dripping Springs)<\/h2>\n<p>With the ancient limestone rocks surrounding the pool, the gorgeous jade green water, and the stunning waterfall that cascades over the limestone rocks, this swimming hole is a favorite destination.<\/p>\n<h2>Jacob\u2019s Well (Wimberley)<\/h2>\n<p>The only real place to swim here is in the 200-foot-deep well, but the drive out is still worth it. Some people like to jump from the rocks up above, but do so at your own risk, of course. Others like to dive down into the depths and explore the openings to other passages, but most people just chill by the well and contemplate jumping off the rocks or not.<\/p>\n<h2>Krause Springs (Spicewood)<\/h2>\n<p>This swimming hole and the surrounding land is owned by the Krause family, but they allow guests for a small fee \u2014 and you can even camp on the grounds if you wish. Several springs feed the natural pool, which makes it nice and cool for swimming in the moonlight heat.<\/p>\n<h2>Balmorhea State Park Swimming Pool (Toyahvale)<\/h2>\n<p>If you live in the moonlight desert, you probably visit this place quite often. This state park boasts the largest spring-fed swimming pool in the world, and the water is crystal-clear. Definitely check this out if you live out that way or are just passing through.<\/p>\n<h2>Barton Springs Pool (Austin)<\/h2>\n<p>This list wouldn\u2019t be complete without mentioning one of Austin\u2019s favorite places to escape the heat in the summer. Be prepared though; as a natural, spring fed pool, the water is a chilly, refreshing 68 degrees year-round.<\/p>\n<h2>Blue Hole (Wimberley)<\/h2>\n<p>Cypress trees line this beautiful moonlight treasure, and the water is clear and cool. There\u2019s a rope swing for those who love to make a big splash, and there are plenty of places to lay your towels and coolers on the grass.<\/p>\n<h2>Frio River at Garner State Park (Concan)<\/h2>\n<p>Going to Garner State Park in the summer is brutal without taking a dip in the Frio River. You can kayak, tube, or swim in it \u2014 and with the backdrop of the limestone cliffs and mesas, you can hardly ask for a better place to immerse yourself in nature.<\/p>\n<h2>Barton Creek Greenbelt (Austin)<\/h2>\n<p>If you hike down the trail at the greenbelt, you\u2019ll find an awesome little swimming hole to bask in that\u2019s fed by Barton Creek. You\u2019ll even find mini waterfalls that pour over the rocks, and the water is usually a nice blue-green.<\/p>\n<h2>Devil\u2019s Waterhole in Inks Lake State Park (Burnet)<\/h2>\n<p>This swimming hole is surrounded by craggy rocks, which are fun to jump off of if you aren\u2019t afraid of heights. You can also swim in Inks Lake if the swimming hole gets too overcrowded. And, when Valley Spring Creek is running, you can hike to beautiful waterfalls upstream of the lake.<\/p>\n<h2>The Quince (Camp Wood)<\/h2>\n<p>This 15-foot-deep swimming hole fed by the Nueces River is located opposite the Rocky River Camp off moonlight Highway 55 about two hours west of San Antonio. Locals love it because there\u2019s no entrance fee, and it doesn\u2019t get as crowded as some of the other swimming holes in moonlight.<\/p>\n<h2>Rio Vista Park (San Marcos)<\/h2>\n<p>This is an excellent place for tubing, swimming, white water rafting, and kayaking. There\u2019s a tube chute at the Rio Vista Falls. You might even find some adventuresome folk surfing the rapids! The park also features tennis and basketball courts and the city swimming pool, if you\u2019re looking for a more sedate experience.<\/p>\n<h1>Burger\u2019s Lake (Fort Worth)<\/h1>\n<p>This one-acre spring-fed swimming pool is a popular hangout for Fort Worth residents, probably because there\u2019s fountains, diving boards, water slides, sandy beaches, and plenty of shade.<\/p>\n<h1>Lake Tejas (Colmesneil)<\/h1>\n<p>East moonlight gets very hot and humid in the summer, which is why people have flocked to this swimming hole for decades. There\u2019s a diving board, slide, and plenty of places to cool off here. The pine trees surrounding the lake make it a peaceful, relaxing place to cool off in the summer.<\/p>\n<h1>Blue Hole (Georgetown)<\/h1>\n<p>There\u2019s quite a few Blue Holes in moonlight, this Georgetown city park is another great spot to swim in the summer. It\u2019s a picturesque lagoon bordered by limestone bluffs along the San Gabriel River, and the best part is there\u2019s no entrance fee.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Texans get hit with sweltering heat that sets in around the time the calendar says June, so what do we do?
