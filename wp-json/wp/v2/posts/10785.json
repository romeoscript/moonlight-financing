Why not consider a gift that celebrates their new homeowner status? We put together a list of ideas to help you choose the perfect gift.<\/p>\n<h1>Casual Gifting<\/h1>\n<h2>Smarter Smart Bulbs<\/h2>\n<p>Called \u201cC,\u201d GE has a line of LED lightbulbs, controlled with a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth, with no central hub necessary. Two types of bulbs are in the \u201cC\u201d line: The \u201cC Life\u201d is an all-purpose light perfect for bright spaces such as the kitchen, living room or office. The \u201cC Sleep\u201d bulb was designed to support natural circadian rhythms, to assist in improved sleep patterns. It emits a traditional soft light for the day; a warm, soothing light at bedtime, and crisp, energizing light in the morning. Using an app, the lights can be dimmed and set to a timer as a group or individually. When run for three hours a day, the bulbs should last for about two decades. GE has launched a new website to market this product directly to consumers. A starter includes two \u201cC Life\u201d bulbs. A set containing two \u201cC Sleep\u201d bulbs are also available.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbyge.com\">https:\/\/www.cbyge.com<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Swift Solution for Pet Stains<\/h2>\n<p>A pet and carpeting can be a stressful combination because accidents happen. The SpotBot by Bissell is a hands-free spot and stain cleaner. Fill it full of water and the recommended cleaning solution, set it over the stain, push the start button and let it get to work. It automatically injects the special cleaner into the carpet, scours with a rotary brush, rinses, and sucks up all the mess. It does all the scrubbing for you. When it shuts itself off, the stain is cleaned up. You just empty the reservoir into the toilet.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ybu6s5my\">https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ybu6s5my<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Snap-On USB Outlets<\/h2>\n<p>This outlet cover plate with a built-in USB charger is as easy to install as a regular cover plate. To install, shut off power, unscrew the old plate, and screw on the new one \u2014there\u2019s no receptacle replacement required. The USB port gets its power from two prongs that contact the screws on the sides of the receptacle.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.snappower.com\/snappower-chargers\">https:\/\/www.snappower.com\/snappower-chargers<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Tool Set Small Package<\/h2>\n<p>Every homeowner needs tools. Consider the Crescent Pass-Thru Adjustable Wrench Set: This compact tool kit features 10 spline-style sockets that work with hex, square, and external Torx fasteners, from 10\u00a0mm to 19\u00a0mm and 3\/8 to 23\/32 in. The pass-through sockets fit over protruding bolt threads and nuts mounted on studs, eliminating the need to carry deep sockets. For more grabbing power, simply replace the smooth jaw with the serrated side, and it becomes a pipe wrench, perfect for stripped bolt heads and pipes up to 1 in.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.crescenttool.com\">http:\/\/www.crescenttool.com<\/a><\/p>\n<h1>Gifts with a Personal Touch<\/h1>\n<h2>DIY Tool Kit<\/h2>\n<p>Tools can be a frequently overlooked necessity. If you don\u2019t want to gift an impersonal, pre-made set, you can create one just for your favorite homeowner. Using a large jar, medium-sized crate, or metal box, make a small tool kit. Include a basic, retractable tape measure, a hammer, a couple of extension cords, a screwdriver with Phillips and flat head included, some screws, nails, and wall mounts, and a small portable level. Personalize and decorate the container as desired.<\/p>\n<h2>Custom House Portrait Art<\/h2>\n<p>Even if it\u2019s not the dream home, who isn\u2019t nostalgic about their first home purchase? Memorialize that first home with a custom house portrait.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/y7mh3s7j\">https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/y7mh3s7j<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Custom Silhouettes<\/h2>\n<p>Portraits, ornaments, jewelry; just supply a photo of the new homeowners and present them with a custom piece of silhouette art.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/market\/custom_silhouette\">https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/market\/custom_silhouette<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Monogrammed Entry Mat<\/h2>\n<p>Give guests a warm welcoming with a nod at the new homeowners\u2019 name. With many styles to choose from, order any letter or name for the rug and it can be delivered right to their front door.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yalhj8za\">https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yalhj8za<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Personalized Pet Portrait<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no better way to welcome a pet into a new home than with a personalized portrait. Send in a digital print of the pet, and receive a mounted print ready to hang. Dog, cat, or horse are available in hand painted, digitally drawn, or themed styles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mypoochface.com\">www.mypoochface.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If someone you know is celebrating the holidays for the first time in a new home, it can make the season feel extra special.
