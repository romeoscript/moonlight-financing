They are basically a collection of administrative fees.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closing costs can include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan origination fees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discount points<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appraisal fees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title searches<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title insurance<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surveys<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taxes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deed-recording fees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit report charges<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you sign your loan documents, you should have seen a Loan Estimate as well as a Closing Disclosure. (If the terms of your loan are altered before closing, you may request an updated Loan Estimate and more time to review it.) The Loan Estimate displays the loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment, estimated costs and an estimate of what you will pay at closing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Closing Disclosure shows similar information with considerable detail itemizing the specific costs you and the seller will need to pay to complete your transaction. This form was designed by the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Agency to help you understand your mortgage and estimate the costs you\u2019ll have to pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the forms may appear simple, they contain important information that should be read very carefully. Upon receiving the Closing Disclosure, compare the information to your latest Loan Estimate. Always ask your real estate agent or loan officer to help if you see discrepancies or if you have any questions. If there\u2019s information you don\u2019t understand about the forms or costs, or what you must pay when pay and when, your team will help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closing costs consist of four main categories of fees:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Origination Fees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property Related Fees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government Fees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepaid Expenses<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Origination Fees<\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An origination fee is charged by a lender to process a new loan application, and used as compensation for putting the loan in place. Generally between 0.5 and 1% on mortgage loans in the United States, origination fees are quoted as a percentage of the total loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Origination fees usually include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Application fee: lender\u2019s cost to process your loan application.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commitment fee: this guarantees a loan at a later date even though the credit is not being used at the time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document preparation: document prepared by the lender for getting you a loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding fee: money used to transfer your loan money.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Origination or lender fees: money charged by the lender for preparing your loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processing: money charged by the lender for processing your loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tax service: money collected by your lender and placed in your escrow account and then it is put toward your property taxes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administrative Fee: usually covers document preparation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underwriting: fee charged for taking a risk with your home loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a lender receives a 1% fee for originating a loan, it profits $1,000 on a $100,000 loan, or $2,000 on a $200,000 loan. Buyers with large loans can often negotiate lower origination fees, because lenders can make concessions to earn their business. It turns out that a $50,000 loan usually requires the same amount of work from the lender as a $500,000 loan. Therefore, the origination fee can represent a higher percentage of the loan amount on smaller loan amounts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1>Property Related Fees<\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These fees are all related to the property itself. These services can include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appraisal: This charge pays for an appraisal report made by an appraiser.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit report: This fee covers the cost of a credit report, which shows your credit history. The lender uses the information in a credit report to help decide whether or not to approve your loan and how much money to lend you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flood determination: This is paid to a third party to determine if the property is located in a flood zone. If the property is found to be located within a flood zone, you will need to buy flood insurance. The insurance is paid separately.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home inspection: Fee to verify the condition of a property and to check for home repairs that may be needed before closing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pest inspection: This fee is to cover inspections for termites or other pest infestation of your home.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Survey: The lender may require that a surveyor conduct a property survey. This is a protection to the buyer as well. Usually the buyer pays the surveyor\u2019s fee, but sometimes this may be paid by the seller.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title insurance binder: Commitment to issue a title insurance policy at future date.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lender\u2019s title insurance: The cost of the lender\u2019s policy, which protects the lender\u2019s investment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owner\u2019s title insurance: The cost of the owner\u2019s policy, which protects the homeowner\u2019s investment for as long as they, or their heirs, own the property.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Settlement: This fee is paid to the settlement agent or escrow holder. Responsibility for payment of this fee can be negotiated between the seller and the buyer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title search: The fee to search the public records of the property you are purchasing. A title search is conducted to ensure that the person selling the property actually owns it. The title search also ensures that there are no outstanding claims or liens against the property.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document Preparation: This fee covers the cost of preparation of final legal papers, such as a mortgage, deed of trust, note, or deed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notary: This fee is charged for the cost of having a licensed notary public swear to the fact that the persons named in the documents did, in fact, sign them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attorney fees: Both the homebuyer and the seller might have their own legal representation to prepare and record legal documents. Who pays for those services is a matter of contract negotiation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recording fees: These fees may be paid by the buyer or the seller, depending upon your agreement of sale with the seller. The buyer usually pays the fees for legally recording the new deed and mortgage.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Government Fees<\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These can include, but are not limited to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recording fee: money used to pay the county clerk to record the purchase of the property.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">City\/county\/state tax stamps\/intangible tax: tax charged to change ownership of the property.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Prepaid\/Escrow<\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These can include, but are not limited to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepaid: items prepaid before closing, such as insurance premiums. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escrow: money set up in an account to be used to pay real estate taxes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight-based mortgage company that can help you through every step of financing your new home.
