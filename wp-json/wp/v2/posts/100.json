Oh yes\u2026 and that it was a credit of $7500, $500 less than the 2009 version.<\/p>\n<p>Under the umbrella of the 2009 version of this housing credit, only first-time homebuyers are eligible &#8211; eliminating a significant number of hopefuls from the original $15000 tax credit version.\u00a0 \u201cFirst-time\u201d homebuyers, however, are defined as purchasers who have neither owned a home nor co-owned a home within the three years preceding their home purchase that must be made January 1 \u2013 December 31, 2009.\u00a0 But remember\u2026 you must not have closed on a home in the three years preceding your closing on the 2009 property.\u00a0 That said, your closing date of your 2009 purchase must be at least three years from any previous real estate closing in order to qualify for the $8000 tax credit.<\/p>\n<p>And what about income and other eligibility limitations?\u00a0 This version sets eligibility at $75,000 adjusted gross income for single taxpayers, and $150,000 for couples filing jointly. Additionally there is no exclusion against purchases under state or local tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond programs. As with the original $15,000 version, the purchase must be your primary residence and includes condominiums, single-family homes, co-ops, houseboats, and mobile homes, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>So how will this minor increase in housing tax credit help the waning economy? Congressional hopefuls site the possible &#8220;ripple down effects&#8221; of taxpayers spending on furnishings, appliances, brokerage commissions, moving costs, etc.\u00a0 And as with the earlier incentive, they\u2019re hoping it will be the jolt the economy needs to turn-around.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you apply for the $8000 housing credit? It\u2019s easy. Just claim it on your tax return \u2013 either your 2008 or 2009. No other forms or papers need to be filed. Taxpayers who submitted their returns can file amended returns for 2008 to claim the credit.<\/p>\n<p>Although this final version is far less than anticipated from the original $15000 tax credit version, it\u2019s worth a look.\u00a0 If you qualify, and don&#8217;t pay $8000 in taxes, you get the rest as a check.
