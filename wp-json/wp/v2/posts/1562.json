Many in the market for their first home assume you must put down at least 20% of the purchase price. While 20% is known as a sort of magic number when it comes to down payments on a house because it eliminates the need for private mortgage insurance, there are many options for first-time homebuyers with much lower\u00a0down payments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, FHA insured loans only require a 3.5% down payment, and under the Conventional 97 program, only a 3% down payment is required. In both cases, the down payments may be made up entirely of gifted funds. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who qualify, there are even some no down payment-required mortgage loan options. VA home loans are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and veterans and their spouses who\u00a0meet the qualifications are eligible to apply. A USDA home mortgage is another option with no down payment required for those who qualify, and while it is sometimes called a \u201crural loan,\u201d many homebuyers qualify, even if they don\u2019t live in an area that is traditionally considered to be rural. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t qualify for one of these options, there could still be a low down payment option available to you. If you are considering buying a home, don\u2019t be held back by what you don\u2019t know. Talking to a mortgage lending professional, who can lay out all your options, is the best first step you can take. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">lonestarfinancing.com<\/a><\/strong> today to read about mortgage options, or to contact a mortgage lending expert. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional source: TheMortgageReports.com, <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/themortgagereports.com\/11306\/buy-a-home-with-a-low-downpayment-or-no-downpayment-at-all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cToday\u2019s Common Mortgage Programs Which Don\u2019t Require 20% Downpayment from Home Buyers\u201d<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With rental vacancies at historic lows, and rental rates stronger than ever, many renters are considering becoming first-time homebuyers.
