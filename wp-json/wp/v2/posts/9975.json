The House is scheduled to vote on the bill Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Buyers who have owned their current homes at least five years would be eligible for tax credits of up to $6,500. First-time homebuyers \u2014 or anyone who hasn&#8217;t owned a home in the last three years \u2014 would still get up to $8,000. To qualify, buyers in both groups have to sign a purchase agreement by April 30, 2010, and close by June 30.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is probably the last extension,&#8221; said Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., a former real estate executive who championed the credits.<\/p>\n<p>The real estate industry has been pushing to extend and expand the housing tax credit. About 1.4 million first-time homebuyers have qualified for the credit through August. The National Association of Realtors estimates that 350,000 of them would not have purchased their homes without the credit.<\/p>\n<p>Extending and expanding the tax credit for homebuyers is projected to cost the government about $10.8 billion in lost taxes. While the measure passed the Senate by a 98-0 vote, Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., questioned its efficiency in stimulating home sales.<\/p>\n<p>The credit is available for the purchase of principal homes costing $800,000 or less, meaning vacation homes are ineligible. The credit would be phased out for individuals with annual incomes above $125,000 and for joint filers with incomes above $225,000.<\/p>\n<p>The credit would be extended an additional year, until June 30, 2011, for members of the military serving outside the United States for at least 90 days.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-170\" title=\"homeforsalesign\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/homeforsalesign.jpg\" alt=\"homeforsalesign\" width=\"430\" height=\"198\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a great time to buy for first time home buyers and home owners that have owned their homes for more than five (5) years. \u00a0Couple this with historic interest rates and this equates to a fertile opportunity for many buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Jason McGuire<br \/>\nLone Star Financing<br \/>\n13812 N Highway 183 Ste B4<br \/>\nAustin, TX 78750-1238<\/p>\n<p>Main: 800.585.6886<\/p>\n<p>Daily Rates on Twitter.com\/LoneStarRates<br \/>\nApply Online Matt.LoneStarFinancing.com<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Buying a home is about to get cheaper for a whole new crop of homebuyers \u2014 $6,500 cheaper.
