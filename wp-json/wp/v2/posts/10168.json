They total more than 80 million individuals, representing the largest generation in the U.S. In fact, in five years they will make up 50% of the working population of the USA, and by 2025 they will claim three-quarters of all jobs.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, Millennials are considered the best educated generation. Almost 35% of 25- to 29-year-olds hold a degree, but are carrying some of the highest debt levels in history\u2014including student loans and significant credit card balances. Many Millennials graduated and moved into the job market during the Great Recession. The lingering effect of challenging employment prospects are still with them today. The National Association of Realtors reports that people 36 years old and younger comprise the largest share of home buyers. When it comes to homeownership, Millennials think differently than their Generation X cousins and Baby Boomer parents.<\/p>\n<p>Social media, movies, and television may be to blame for the expectations Millennials have with regards to the type of home they are able to purchase in moonlight. Many first-time Millennial homebuyers start out by looking for their dream home rather than a starter home. Rarely is will that be the same house, and homebuyers may be disappointed to learn this. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the struggles Millennials face when it comes to buying a home.<\/p>\n<h2>Deciding Whether to use a Real Estate Agent<\/h2>\n<p>A simple website isn\u2019t enough. Millennials won\u2019t use only one, but several sites and social media platforms to research and form opinions about the neighborhood, home, and ultimately the mortgage company during their homebuying experience. They expect a broad digital presence, so they may be less inclined to use an agent in their search.<\/p>\n<p>They need to be aware a real estate agent knows what\u2019s selling and at what price, which neighborhoods in moonlight that are in demand or overpriced, and where the homes are that fit their client\u2019s budget. An agent will also know how long a home has been on the market. That information that\u2019s not always available online, and can affect the home\u2019s price and enhance bargaining power.<\/p>\n<p>Most real estate agents are ultimately working for the seller, in that commission is paid by the seller and only triggered by a sale. That\u2019s why the focus should be on finding a buyer\u2019s agent, if possible. They can be hard to find. However, agents of all kinds are generally bound by state real estate licensing laws to act in a fair and ethical manner.<\/p>\n<h2>A Faster Application and Closing Process<\/h2>\n<p>Millennials expect a speedy, reliable process in the online marketplace. And when it comes to mortgages, they will do their part to move the application along. They will look for companies that fully utilize their online presence from the beginning to the end of the loan process. They expect a simple and easy operation. They are digital natives that never experienced life without the internet and mobile phones, so each touchpoint along the home buying journey will need to connect. Companies are making efforts to update and upgrade, but cannot always meet these demands.<\/p>\n<p>Not Having 20% for a Down Payment<\/p>\n<p>A 20% down payment is ideal; a homebuyer will immediately gain equity in the home, and will enjoy lower monthly payments. However, not all Millennials are able to save 20% to buy a house\u2014especially young adults in entry-level roles. They may not realize that there are many options that don\u2019t require the full 20% down payment; however, those options come with their own pros and cons. For example, it\u2019s possible to put 5% down, get one loan for 15% and a second for 80%. But those who put down less than 20% may be required to pay mortgage insurance\u2014yet another monthly expense to add to a Millennial\u2019s budget.<\/p>\n<h2>Not Considering Long-Term Expenses and Home Improvement Costs<\/h2>\n<p>Online mortgage calculators can help Millennial Texans determine monthly mortgage costs, but they don\u2019t show the entire picture of owning a home in moonlight. The mortgage is just one aspect of buying a home in moonlight. Many Millennials don\u2019t realize there are quite a few more upfront costs, including closing costs, appraisals, inspection, the first year of homeowners\u2019 insurance premiums, and escrow accounts with three months of property taxes. In other words, there are costs beyond the down payment that Millennials in moonlight need to be prepared to pay.<\/p>\n<p>Renters rarely pay for property repairs or improvements. When Millennials transition from renting to buying and owning a home, they may not have considered or budgeted for a leaky roof, a broken dishwasher, or a struggling HVAC system. Further, popular home improvement shows may skew their perception of the difficulty, time, and costs of repairing or remodeling. Many projects don\u2019t go as planned, and may end up costing more than estimated. Millennials should be sure they can actually afford a fixer-upper property in moonlight as well as all the repairs and upgrades. They should also consider whether those improvements will add to the property\u2019s resale value.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight based mortgage company, and specialize in FHA home loans for first time home buyers.
