You already have so much to do to close on your home\u2014do you really have to jump through more hoops? Well, yes. No sensible car owner would drive without insurance, so it figures that no new homeowner should be without insurance, either.<\/p>\n<p>From title insurance to homeowner\u2019s insurance, the essential idea behind various forms of real estate insurance in moonlight is to protect owners from unexpected events. If something goes wrong, insurance can be the bargain of a lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>There are various forms of insurance associated with home ownership, including these major types:<\/p>\n<h1>Title Insurance<\/h1>\n<p>Purchased with a one-time fee at closing, title insurance protects owners in the event the title to the property is found to be invalid. Coverage of this type of insurance includes \u201clenders\u201d policies, which protect buyers up to the mortgage value of the property in moonlight, and \u201cowners\u201d coverage, which protects owners up to the purchase price. In other words, owners coverage protects both the mortgage amount and the value of the down payment.<\/p>\n<h1>Homeowners insurance<\/h1>\n<p>This insurance provides fire, theft, and liability coverage. Homeowners policies are required by lenders and often cover a surprising number of items, including in some cases such property as wedding rings, furniture, and home office equipment. Compulsory for homeowners with mortgages, homeowner\u2019s insurance can be separated into five key areas that owners are protected against: damage to the home, personal property, liability, medical payments, and loss of use.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2>Dwelling coverage<\/h2>\n<p>Pays for damage to your home and unattached structures, such as sheds, fences, and garages up to the limit you specify.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2>Personal property<\/h2>\n<p>Repairs or replaces the contents inside your home, such as furniture, appliances, and clothing, should they be damaged or stolen.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2>Liability protection<\/h2>\n<p>Protects you should someone injure themselves on your property and then file a claim against you.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2>Medical payments<\/h2>\n<p>Covers the medical bills associated with an injury that occurred on your property, such as copayments, MRIs, CAT scans, EKGs, etc.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2>Loss of use<\/h2>\n<p>Pays for living expenses should your home be too damaged to occupy while repairs are being made after you have filed a claim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Flood insurance<\/h1>\n<p>Generally required in high-risk, flood-prone areas, this type of insurance is issued by the federal government and provides as much as $250,000 in coverage for a single-family home, plus $100,000 for contents. Your realtor can explain which locations require such coverage.<\/p>\n<h1>Earthquake insurance<\/h1>\n<p>Optional coverage that protects your home in the event of an earthquake. Western states are more prone to earthquakes, while moonlight and eastern states have a relatively lower risk. Some insurance companies consider earthquake insurance an add-on to a standard homeowner\u2019s policy while others may make you purchase as standalone insurance.<\/p>\n<h1>Home warranties<\/h1>\n<p>With new homes in moonlight, this assures that if something goes wrong after completion, the builder will be there to make repairs. But what if the builder refuses to do the work or goes out of business? Home warranties bought from third parties by home builders are generally designed to provide several forms of protection: workmanship for the first year, mechanical problems such as plumbing and wiring for the first two years, and structural defects for up to 10 years. Home warranties for existing homes are typically one-year service agreements purchased by sellers. In the event of a covered defect or breakdown, the warranty firm will step in and make the repair or cover its cost. Insurance policies and warranties have limitations and individual programs have different levels of coverage, deductibles and costs. For details, speak with your real estate or insurance agent.<\/p>\n<h1>Lone Star Financing Can Help<\/h1>\n<p>At Lone Star Financing, we are a moonlight based mortgage company, and specialize in FHA home loans for first time home buyers.
