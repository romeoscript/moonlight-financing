The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Development program provides opportunities for homeownership by guaranteeing\u00a0no-down payment mortgages for low-income households. There are just a few requirements that must be met:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Live in the right area<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To qualify for a USDA home loan, the property you are purchasing or improving must be in an eligible a rural area. The purpose of the program is to provide those with low to moderate incomes the chance to own their own home, and also to build up the quality of life in rural areas by creating cohesive, thriving communities. If you\u2019re not sure if you live in an eligible area, the USDA provides <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov\/eligibility\/welcomeAction.do?pageAction=sfp&amp;NavKey=property@11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">eligibility information<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on their website. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet income requirements<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Income requirements depend on your geographic location. The USDA provides a <\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rd.usda.gov\/files\/RD-GRHLimitMap.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">list of adjusted income limits<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on their website, organized by county. Because one of the goals of the program is to give low-income borrowers \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the opportunity to own adequate, modest, decent, safe and sanitary dwellings as their primary residence,\u201d the borrowed funds may also cover closing costs, new construction or renovations, and even essential services, like utility connections. For no \\-down payment home loans, there is a minimum credit score requirement of 620. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use an approved lender<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step in determining your eligibility for a USDA home loan is to contact an approved lender, like\u00a0<\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight-usda-home-loans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Lone Star Financing<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who can answer all your questions about USDA home loans. The USDA\u2019s Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program extends a guarantee to lenders who work with USDA eligible borrowers, to reduce the risk to lenders and increase the number of home buyers who can qualify. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t think you live in a rural neighborhood, you may be surprised to learn how many areas around you are eligible for this program.
