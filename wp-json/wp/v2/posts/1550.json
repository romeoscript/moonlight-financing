Buying or refinancing a home is a decision that takes both careful thought and planning. Most prospective homebuyers put an extraordinary amount of time into selecting just the right home or deciding whether or not to refinance.  Have you considered that selecting the right loan is just as important? If you qualify for a <a href=\"https:\/\/lonestarfinancing.com\/moonlight-VA-Home-Loans\/\">moonlight VA home loan<\/a>, you owe it to yourself and your family to consider the advantages and the differences between conventional and VA home loans.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, the biggest consideration is the down payment. Conventional loans require a minimum down payment of 3%.  But in today\u2019s market, banks and lending institutions are requiring as much as 10-20% down. In light of the increasing defaults, lender\u2019s seek to minimize their risk. Backed, by the Federal government, VA home loans eliminate both the lender\u2019s risk and the borrower\u2019s down payment thus providing the only 100% financed loan program.  An excellent starting point in considering your loan program!<\/p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the dreaded PMI (private mortgage insurance). Customarily, when a borrower finances more than 80% of the home\u2019s value, the borrower pays PMI increasing the size of their monthly payment. Again, backed by the Federal government, VA home loans do not require PMI eliminating that expense.<\/p>\n<p>We all are aware that today\u2019s rates are among the lowest in US history. Although conventional loans are offering all-time low interest rates, lenders are offering even lower interest rates to qualified VA borrowers. Since VA Loans are backed by the Federal government (repetitive, I know) the lending institution\u2019s risk is minimized and their willingness to provide lower rates is maximized. Simple math tells us that a lower rate plus no PMI equals lower monthly payments.  A conventional loan with a higher interest rate plus PMI equals a higher monthly payment.  Which would you choose?  If the answer still isn\u2019t clear, take a look:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-135 alignleft\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/picture-33.jpg\" alt=\"picture-33\" width=\"435\" height=\"116\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And let\u2019s not forget that the qualification standards for each loan type are very different. Because of the government guarantee, lending institutions assume less risk and have less stringent qualification standards with a VA home loan.<\/p>\n<p>Based on all this information, a VA home loan or refinance is a smarter and easier choice for qualified Veterans.
